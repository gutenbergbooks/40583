<h1>THE GOD IN THE CAR.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>AN INSOLENT MEMORY.</h3>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m so blind," said Miss Ferrars plaintively.
"Where are my glasses?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you want to see?" asked Lord Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"The man in the corner, talking to Mr. Loring."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you won&#39;t know him even with the glasses.
He&#39;s the sort of man you must be introduced to three
times before there&#39;s any chance of a permanent impression."</p>

<p class="indent">"You seem to recognise him."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know him in business. We are, or rather are
going to be, fellow-directors of a company."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, then I shall see you in the dock together
some day."</p>

<p class="indent">"What touching faith in the public prosecutor!
Does nothing shake your optimism?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps your witticisms."</p>

<p class="indent">"Peace, peace!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, who is he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He was once," observed Lord Semingham, as
though stating a curious fact, "in a Government.
His name is Foster Belford, and he is still asked to
the State Concerts."</p>

<p class="indent">"I knew I knew him! Why, Harry Dennison
thinks great things of him!"</p>

<p class="indent">"It is possible."</p>

<p class="indent">"And he, not to be behindhand in politeness,
thinks greater of Maggie Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">"His task is the easier."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you and he are going to have the effrontery
to ask shareholders to trust their money to you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, it isn&#39;t us; it&#39;s Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Ruston? I&#39;ve heard of him."</p>

<p class="indent">"You very rarely admit that about anybody."</p>

<p class="indent">"Moreover, I&#39;ve met him."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s quite coming to the front, of late, I know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is there any positive harm in being in the fashion?
I like now and then to talk to the people one is
obliged to talk about."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go on," said Lord Semingham, urbanely.</p>

<p class="indent">"But, my dear Lord Semingham&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush! Keep the truth from me, like a kind
woman. Ah! here comes Tom Loring&mdash;&mdash;How are
you, Loring? Where&#39;s Dennison?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"At the House. I ought to be there, too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, of course. The place of a private secretary
is by the side of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"His chief&#39;s wife. We all know that," interposed
Adela Ferrars.</p>

<p class="indent">"When you grow old, you&#39;ll be sorry for all the
wicked things you&#39;ve said," observed Loring.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, there&#39;ll be nothing else to do. Where are
you going, Lord Semingham?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Home."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I&#39;ve done my duty. Oh, but here&#39;s
Dennison, and I want a word with him."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham passed on, leaving the other two
together.</p>

<p class="indent">"Has Harry Dennison been speaking to-day?"
asked Miss Ferrars.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he had something prepared."</p>

<p class="indent">"He had something! You know you write them."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Loring frowned.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and I know we aren&#39;t allowed to say so,"
pursued Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s neither just nor kind to Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Ferrars looked at him, her brows slightly
raised.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you are both just and kind, really," he
added.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you, Mr. Loring, are a wonderful man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
You&#39;re not ashamed to be serious! Oh, yes, I&#39;ve annoyed&mdash;you&#39;re
quite right. I was&mdash;whatever I was&mdash;on
the ninth of last March, and I think I&#39;m too old to
be lectured."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom Loring laughed, and, an instant later, Adela
followed suit.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose it was horrid of me," she said. "Can&#39;t
we turn it round and consider it as a compliment to
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Tom looked doubtful, but, before he could answer,
Adela cried:</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, here&#39;s Evan Haselden, and&mdash;yes&mdash;it&#39;s Mr.
Ruston with him?"</p>

<p class="indent">As the two men entered, Mrs. Dennison rose from
her chair. She was a tall woman; her years fell one
or two short of thirty. She was not a beauty, but her
broad brow and expressive features, joined to a certain
subdued dignity of manner and much grace of movement,
made her conspicuous among the women in her
drawing-room. Young Evan Haselden seemed to appreciate
her, for he bowed his glossy curly head, and
shook hands in a way that almost turned the greeting
into a deferentially distant caress. Mrs. Dennison acknowledged
his hinted homage with a bright smile,
and turned to Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"At last!" she said, with another smile. "The
first time after&mdash;how many years?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Eight, I believe," he answered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you&#39;re terribly definite. And what have you
been doing with yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">He shrugged his square shoulders, and she did not
press her question, but let her eyes wander over him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh&mdash;improved. And I?"</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Ruston laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Last time we met," he said, "you swore you&#39;d
never speak to me again."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;d quite forgotten my fearful threat."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked straight in her face for a moment, as
he asked&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"And the cause of it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison coloured.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, quite," she answered; and conscious that
her words carried no conviction to him, she added
hastily, "Go and speak to Harry. There he is."</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston obeyed her, and being left for a moment
alone, she sat down on the chair placed ready near
the door for her short intervals of rest. There was a
slight pucker on her brow. The sight of Ruston and
his question stirred in her thoughts, which were never
long dormant, and which his coming woke into sudden
activity. She had not anticipated that he would
venture to recall to her that incident&mdash;at least, not at
once&mdash;in the first instant of meeting, at such a time
and such a place. But as he had, she found herself
yielding to the reminiscence he induced. Forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
the cause of her anger with him? For the first two
or three years of her married life, she would have
answered, "Yes, I have forgotten it." Then had
come a period when now and again it recurred to her,
not for his sake or its own, but as a summary of her
stifled feeling; and during that period she had resolutely
struggled not to remember it. Of late that
struggle had ceased, and the thing lay a perpetual
background to her thoughts: when there was nothing
else to think about, when the stage of her mind was
empty of moving figures, it snatched at the chance
of prominence, and thus became a recurrent consciousness
from which her interests and her occupations
could not permanently rescue her. For example,
here she was thinking of it in the very midst of
her party. Yet this persistence of memory seemed
impertinent, unreasonable, almost insolent. For, as
she told herself, finding it necessary to tell herself
more and more often, her husband was still all that
he had been when he had won her heart&mdash;good-looking,
good-tempered, infinitely kind and devoted.
When she married she had triumphed confidently in
these qualities; and the unanimous cry of surprised
congratulations at the match she was making had
confirmed her own joy and exultation in it. It had
been a great match; and yet, beyond all question, also
a love match.</p>

<p class="indent">But now the chorus of wondering applause was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
forgotten, and there remained only the one voice
which had been raised to break the harmony of approbation&mdash;a
voice that nobody, herself least of all,
had listened to then. How should it be listened to?
It came from a nobody&mdash;a young man of no account,
whose opinion none cared to ask; whose judgment,
had it been worth anything in itself, lay under suspicion
of being biassed by jealousy. Willie Ruston
had never declared himself her suitor; yet (she clung
hard to this) he would not have said what he did had
not the chagrin of a defeated rival inspired him; and
a defeated rival, as everybody knows, will say anything.
Certainly she had been right not to listen,
and was wrong to remember. To this she had often
made up her mind, and to this she returned now as
she sat watching her husband and Willie Ruston, forgetful
of all the chattering crowd beside.</p>

<p class="indent">As to what it was she resolved not to remember,
and did remember, it was just one sentence&mdash;his only
comment on the news of her engagement, his only
hint of any opinion or feeling about it. It was short,
sharp, decisive, and, as his judgments were, even in
the days when he, alone of all the world, held them of
any moment, absolutely confident; it was also, she
had felt on hearing it, utterly untrue, unjust, and ungenerous.
It had rung out like a pistol-shot, "Maggie,
you&#39;re marrying a fool," and then a snap of tight-fitting
lips, a glance of scornful eyes, and a quick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
unhesitating stride away that hardly waited for a contemptuous
smile at her angry cry, "I&#39;ll never speak
to you again." She had been in a fury of wrath&mdash;she
had a power of wrath&mdash;that a plain, awkward, penniless,
and obscure youth&mdash;one whom she sometimes
disliked for his arrogance, and sometimes derided for
his self-confidence&mdash;should dare to say such a thing
about her Harry, whom she was so proud to love, and
so proud to have won. It was indeed an insolent
memory that flung the thing again and again in her
teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">The party began to melt away. The first good-bye
roused Mrs. Dennison from her enveloping reverie.
Lady Valentine, from whom it came, lingered
for a gush of voluble confidences about the charm of
the house, and the people, and the smart little band
that played softly in an alcove, and what not; her
daughter stood by, learning, it is to be hoped, how it
is meet to behave in society, and scanning Evan Haselden&#39;s
trim figure with wary, critical glances, alert to
turn aside if he should glance her way. Mrs. Dennison
returned the ball of civility, and, released by several
more departures, joined Adela Ferrars. Adela
stood facing Haselden and Tom Loring, who were
arm-in-arm. At the other end of the room Harry
Dennison and Ruston were still in conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">"These <i>men</i>, Maggie," began Adela&mdash;and it seemed
a mere caprice of pronunciation, that the word did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
not shape itself into "monkeys"&mdash;"are the absurdest
creatures. They say I&#39;m not fit to take part in politics!
And why?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison shook her head, and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Because, if you please, I&#39;m too emotional. Emotional,
indeed! And I can&#39;t generalise! Oh, couldn&#39;t
I generalise about men!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Women can never say &#39;No,&#39;" observed Evan
Haselden, not in the least as if he were repeating a
commonplace.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll find you&#39;re wrong when you grow up,"
retorted Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"I doubt that," said Mrs. Dennison, with the
kindest of smiles.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, you spoil the boy. Isn&#39;t it enough that
he should have gone straight from the fourth form&mdash;where,
I suppose, he learnt to generalise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"At any rate, not to be emotional," murmured
Loring.</p>

<p class="indent">"Into Parliament, without having his head turned
by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;d better go, Evan," suggested Loring in a
warning tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall go too," announced Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m walking your way," said Evan, who seemed
to bear no malice.</p>

<p class="indent">"How delightful!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t object?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Not the least. I&#39;m driving."</p>

<p class="indent">"A mere schoolboy score!"</p>

<p class="indent">"How stupid of me! You haven&#39;t had time to
forget them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, take her away," said Mrs. Dennison, and
they disappeared in a fire of retorts, happy, or happy
enough for happy people, and probably Evan drove
with the lady after all.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison walked towards where her husband
and Ruston sat on a sofa in talk.</p>

<p class="indent">"What are you two conspiring about?" she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ruston had something to say to me about business."</p>

<p class="indent">"What, already?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, we&#39;ve met in the city, Mrs. Dennison," explained
Ruston, with a confidential nod to Harry.</p>

<p class="indent">"And that was the object of your appearance here
to-day? I was flattering my party, it seems."</p>

<p class="indent">"No. I didn&#39;t expect to find your husband. I
thought he would be at the House."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, Harry, how did the speech go?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, really pretty well, I think," answered Harry
Dennison, with a contented air. "I got nearly half
through before we were counted out."</p>

<p class="indent">A very faint smile showed on his wife&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you were counted out?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, or I shouldn&#39;t be here."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"You see, I am acquitted, Mrs. Dennison. Only
an accident brought him here."</p>

<p class="indent">"An accident impossible to foresee," she acquiesced,
with the slightest trace of bitterness&mdash;so
slight that her husband did not notice it.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston rose.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you&#39;d better talk to Semingham about it,"
he remarked to Harry Dennison; "he&#39;s one of us,
you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I will. And I&#39;ll just get you that pamphlet
of mine; you can put it in your pocket."</p>

<p class="indent">He ran out of the room to fetch what he promised.
Mrs. Dennison, still faintly smiling, held out her hand
to Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s been very pleasant to see you again," she
said graciously. "I hope it won&#39;t be eight years
before our next meeting."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no; you see I&#39;m floating now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Floating?" she repeated, with a smile of enquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; on the surface. I&#39;ve been in the depths
till very lately, and there one meets no good society."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! You&#39;ve had a struggle?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he answered, laughing; "you may call it a
bit of a struggle."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him with grave curious eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you are not married?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I&#39;m glad to say."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Why glad, Mr. Ruston? Some people like being
married."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I don&#39;t claim to be above it, Mrs. Dennison,"
he answered with a laugh, "but a wife would have
been a great hindrance to me all these years."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a simple and <i>bona fide</i> air about his
statement; it was not raillery; and Mrs. Dennison
laughed in her turn.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, how like you!" she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Ruston, with a passing gleam of surprise at
her merriment, bade her a very unemotional farewell,
and left her. She sat down and waited idly for her
husband&#39;s return. Presently he came in. He had
caught Ruston in the hall, delivered his pamphlet,
and was whistling cheerfully. He took a chair near
his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rum chap that!" he said. "But he&#39;s got a good
deal of stuff in him;" and he resumed his lively tune.</p>

<p class="indent">The tune annoyed Mrs. Dennison. To suffer
whistling without visible offence was one of her daily
trials. Harry&#39;s emotions and reflections were prone
to express themselves through that medium.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t do half-badly, to-day," said Harry, breaking
off again. "Old Tom had got it all splendidly in
shape for me&mdash;by Jove, I don&#39;t know what I should
do without Tom&mdash;and I think I put it pretty well.
But, of course, it&#39;s a subject that doesn&#39;t catch on
with everybody."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span></p>

<p class="indent">It was the dullest subject in the world; it was
also, in all likelihood, one of the most unimportant;
and dull subjects are so seldom unimportant that the
perversity of the combination moved Maggie Dennison
to a wondering pity. She rose and came behind
the chair where her husband sat. Leaning over the
back, she rested her elbows on his shoulders, and
lightly clasped her hands round his neck. He
stopped his whistle, which had grown soft and contented,
laughed, and kissed one of the encircling
hands, and she, bending lower, kissed him on the
forehead as he turned his face up to look at her.</p>

<p class="indent">"You poor dear old thing!" she said with a smile
and a sigh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE COINING OF A NICKNAME.</h3>

<p class="indent">When it was no later than the middle of June,
Adela Ferrars, having her reputation to maintain,
ventured to sum up the season. It was, she said, a
Ruston-cum-Violetta season. Violetta&#39;s doings and
unexampled triumphs have, perhaps luckily, no place
here; her dancing was higher and her songs more
surpassing in another dimension than those of any
performer who had hitherto won the smiles of society;
and young men who are getting on in life still
talk about her. Ruston&#39;s fame was less widespread,
but his appearance was an undeniable fact of the
year. When a man, the first five years of whose adult
life have been spent on a stool in a coal merchant&#39;s
office, and the second five somewhere (an absolutely
vague somewhere) in Southern or Central Africa,
comes before the public, offering in one closed hand a
new empire, or, to avoid all exaggeration, at least a
province, asking with the other opened hand for three
million pounds, the public is bound to afford him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
the tribute of some curiosity. When he enlists in his
scheme men of eminence like Mr. Foster Belford, of
rank like Lord Semingham, of great financial resources
like Dennison Sons &amp; Company, he becomes
one whom it is expedient to bid to dinner and examine
with scrutinising enquiry. He may have a bag
of gold for you; or you may enjoy the pleasure of exploding
his <i>prestige</i>; at least, you are timely and up-to-date,
and none can say that your house is a den of
fogies, or yourself, in the language made to express
these things (for how otherwise should they get
themselves expressed?) on other than "the inner
rail."</p>

<p class="indent">It chanced that Miss Ferrars arrived early at the
Seminghams, and she talked with her host on the
hearth-rug, while Lady Semingham was elaborately
surveying her small but comely person in a mirror at
the other end of the long room. Lord Semingham
was rather short and rather stout; he hardly looked
as if his ancestors had fought at Hastings&mdash;perhaps
they had not, though the peerage said they had. He
wore close-cut black whiskers, and the blue of his
jowl witnessed a suppressed beard of great vitality.
His single eye-glass reflected answering twinkles to
Adela&#39;s <i>pince-nez</i>, and his mouth was puckered at
the world&#39;s constant entertainment; men said that
he found his wife alone a sufficient and inexhaustible
amusement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"The Heathers are coming," he said, "and Lady
Val and Marjory, and young Haselden, and Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Toujours</i> Ruston," murmured Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"And one or two more. What&#39;s wrong with Ruston?
There is, my dear Adela, no attitude more offensive
than that of indifference to what the common
herd finds interesting."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s a fright," said Adela. "You&#39;d spike yourself
on that bristly beard of his."</p>

<p class="indent">"If you happened to be near enough, you mean?&mdash;a
danger my sex and our national habits render
remote. Bessie!"</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Semingham came towards them, with one
last craning look at her own back as she turned.
She always left the neighbourhood of a mirror with
regret.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" she asked with a patient little sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Adela is abusing your friend Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s not my friend, Alfred. What&#39;s the matter,
Adela?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t think I like him. He&#39;s hard."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s got a demon, you see," said Semingham.
"For that matter we all have, but his is a whopper."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, what&#39;s my demon?" cried Adela. Is not
oneself always the most interesting subject?</p>

<p class="indent">"Yours? Cleverness; He goads you into saying
things one can&#39;t see the meaning of."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks! And yours?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Grinning&mdash;so I grin at your things, though I
don&#39;t understand &#39;em."</p>

<p class="indent">"And Bessie&#39;s?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, forgive me. Leave us a quiet home."</p>

<p class="indent">"And now, Mr. Ruston&#39;s?"</p>

<p class="indent">"His is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">But the door opened, and the guests, all arriving
in a heap, just twenty minutes late, flooded the room
and drowned the topic. Another five minutes passed,
and people had begun furtively to count heads and
wonder whom they were waiting for, when Evan
Haselden was announced. Hot on his heels came
Ruston, and the party was completed.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Otto Heather took Adela Ferrars in to dinner.
Her heart sank as he offered his arm. She
had been heard to call him the silliest man in Europe;
on the other hand, his wife, and some half-dozen
people besides, thought him the cleverest in
London.</p>

<p class="indent">"That man," he said, swallowing his soup and
nodding his head towards Ruston, "personifies all the
hideous tendencies of the age&mdash;its brutality, its commercialism,
its selfishness, its&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Ferrars looked across the table. Ruston was
seated at Lady Semingham&#39;s left hand, and she was
prattling to him in her sweet indistinct little voice.
Nothing in his appearance warranted Heather&#39;s outburst,
unless it were a sort of alert and almost defiant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
readiness, smacking of a challenge to catch him napping.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not a mediævalist myself," she observed,
and prepared to endure the penalty of an <i>exposé</i> of
Heather&#39;s theories. During its progress, she peered&mdash;for
her near sight was no affectation&mdash;now and again at
the occasion of her sufferings. She had heard a good
deal about him&mdash;something from her host, something
from Harry Dennison, more from the paragraphists
who had scented their prey, and gathered from the
four quarters of heaven (or wherever they dwelt)
upon him. She knew about the coal merchant&#39;s
office, the impatient flight from it, and the rush
over the seas; there were stories of real naked want,
where a bed and shelter bounded for the moment
all a life&#39;s aspirations. She summed him up as a
buccaneer modernised; and one does not expect
buccaneers to be amiable, while culture in them
would be an incongruity. It was, on the whole,
not very surprising, she thought, that few people
liked William Roger Ruston&mdash;nor that many believed
in him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t you agree with me?" asked Heather.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not in the least," said Adela at random.</p>

<p class="indent">The odds that he had been saying something foolish
were very large.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought you were such friends!" exclaimed
Heather in surprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, to confess, I was thinking of something
else. Who do you mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, Mrs. Dennison. I was saying that her
calm queenly manner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Good gracious, Mr. Heather, don&#39;t call women
&#39;queenly.&#39; You&#39;re like&mdash;what is it?&mdash;a &#39;dime
novel.&#39;"</p>

<p class="indent">If this comparison were meant to relieve her from
the genius&#39; conversation for the rest of dinner, it
was admirably conceived. He turned his shoulder on
her in undisguised dudgeon.</p>

<p class="indent">"And how&#39;s the great scheme?" asked somebody
of Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"We hope to get the money," he said, turning for
a moment from his hostess. "And if we do that,
we&#39;re all right."</p>

<p class="indent">"Everything&#39;s going on very well," called Semingham
from the foot of the table. "They&#39;ve killed a
missionary."</p>

<p class="indent">"How dreadful!" lisped his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">"Regrettable in itself, but the first step towards
empire," explained Semingham with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s to stop things of that kind that we are going
there," Mr. Belford pronounced; the speech was evidently
meant to be repeated, and to rank as authoritative.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course," chuckled Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">If he had been a shopman, he could not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
resisted showing his customers how the adulteration
was done.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of herself&mdash;for she strongly objected to
being one of an admiring crowd, and liked a personal
<i>cachet</i> on her emotions&mdash;Adela felt pleasure when,
after dinner, Ruston came straight to her and, displacing
Evan Haselden, sat down by her side. He
assumed the position with a business-like air, as
though he meant to stay. She often, indeed habitually,
had two or three men round her, but to-night
none contested Ruston&#39;s exclusive possession; she
fancied that the business-like air had something to do
with it. She had been taken possession of, she said
to herself, with a little impatience and yet a little
pleasure also.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know everybody here, I suppose?" he asked.
His tone cast a doubt on the value of the knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s my tenth season," said Adela, with a laugh.
"I stopped counting them once, but there comes a
time when one has to begin again."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her&mdash;critically, she thought&mdash;as he
said,</p>

<p class="indent">"The ravages of time no longer to be ignored?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, the exaggerations of friends to be checked.
Yes, I suppose I know most of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">She paused for a word.</p>

<p class="indent">"The gang," he suggested, leaning back and crossing
his legs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, we are a gang, and all on one chain. You&#39;re
a recent captive, though."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he assented, "it&#39;s pretty new to me. A
year ago I hadn&#39;t a dress coat."</p>

<p class="indent">"The gods are giving you a second youth then."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I take it. I don&#39;t know that I have much
to thank the gods for."</p>

<p class="indent">"They&#39;ve been mostly against you, haven&#39;t they?
However, what does that matter, if you beat
them?"</p>

<p class="indent">He did not disdain her compliment, but neither
did he accept it. He ignored it, and Adela, who paid
very few compliments, was amused and vexed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps," she added, "you think your victory
still incomplete?"</p>

<p class="indent">This gained no better attention. Mr. Ruston
seemed to be following his own thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">"It must be a curious thing," he remarked, "to
be born to a place like Semingham&#39;s."</p>

<p class="indent">"And to use it&mdash;or not to use it&mdash;like Lord Semingham?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I was thinking of that," he admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">"To be eminent requires some self-deception,
doesn&#39;t it? Without that, it would seem too absurd.
I think Lord Semingham is overweighted with humour."
She paused and then&mdash;to show that she was
not in awe of him&mdash;she added,&mdash;"Now, I should say,
you have very little."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Very little, indeed, I should think," he agreed
composedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re the only man I ever heard admit that of
himself; we all say it of one another."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know what I have and haven&#39;t got pretty well."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela was beginning to be more sure that she disliked
him, but the topic had its interest for her and
she went on,</p>

<p class="indent">"Now I like to think I&#39;ve got everything."</p>

<p class="indent">To her annoyance, the topic seemed to lose interest
for him, just in proportion as it gained interest for
her. In fact, Mr. Ruston did not apparently care to
talk about what she liked or didn&#39;t like.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who&#39;s that pretty girl over there," he asked,
"talking to young Haselden?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Marjory Valentine," said Adela curtly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! I think I should like to talk to her."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray, don&#39;t let me prevent you," said Adela in
very distant tones.</p>

<p class="indent">The man seemed to have no manners.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Ruston said nothing, but gave a short laugh.
Adela was not accustomed to be laughed at openly.
Yet she felt defenceless; this pachydermatous animal
would be impervious to the pricks of her rapier.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re amused?" she asked sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why were you in such a hurry to take offence?
I didn&#39;t say I wanted to go and talk to her now."</p>

<p class="indent">"It sounded like it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well, I&#39;m very sorry," he conceded, still smiling,
and obviously thinking her very absurd.</p>

<p class="indent">She rose from her seat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please do, though. She&#39;ll be going soon, and
you mayn&#39;t get another chance."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I will then," he answered simply, accompanying
the remark with a nod of approval for her
sensible reminder. And he went at once.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw him touch Haselden on the shoulder, and
make the young man present him to Marjory. Ruston
sat down and Haselden drifted, aimless and forlorn,
on a solitary passage along the length of the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela joined Lady Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s a dreadful man, Bessie," she said; "he&#39;s a
regular Juggernaut."</p>

<p class="indent">She disturbed Lady Semingham in a moment of
happiness; everybody had been provided with conversation,
and the hostess could sit in peaceful silence,
looking, and knowing that she looked, very dainty
and pretty; she liked that much better than talking.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who&#39;s what, dear?" she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">"That man&mdash;Mr. Ruston. I say he&#39;s a Juggernaut.
If you&#39;re in the way, he just walks over you&mdash;and
sometimes when you&#39;re not: for fun, I suppose."</p>

<p class="indent">"Alfred says he&#39;s very clever," observed Lady Semingham,
in a tone that evaded any personal responsibility
for the truth of the statement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I dislike him very much," declared Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"We won&#39;t have him again when you&#39;re coming,
dear," promised her friend soothingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela looked at her, hesitated, opened her fan,
shut it again, and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I didn&#39;t mean that, Bessie," she said with
half a laugh. "Do, please."</p>

<p class="indent">"But if you dislike him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, my dear, doesn&#39;t one hate half the men one
likes meeting&mdash;and all the women!"</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Semingham smiled amiably. She did not
care to think out what that meant; it was Adela&#39;s
way, just as it was her husband&#39;s way to laugh at
many things that seemed to her to afford no opening
for mirth. But Adela was not to escape. Semingham
himself appeared suddenly at her elbow, and
observed,</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s either nonsense or a truism, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Neither," said Adela with spirit; but her defence
was interrupted by Evan Haselden.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m going," said he, and he looked out of temper.
"I&#39;ve got another place to go to. And anyhow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;d like to be somewhere where that chap Ruston
isn&#39;t for a little while."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela glanced across. Ruston was still talking to
Marjory Valentine.</p>

<p class="indent">"What can he find to say to her?" thought Adela.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"What the deuce she finds to talk about to that
fellow, I can&#39;t think," pursued Evan, and he flung off
to bid Lady Semingham good-night.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela caught her host&#39;s eye and laughed. Lord
Semingham&#39;s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s a big province," he observed, "so there may
be room for him&mdash;out there."</p>

<p class="indent">"I," said Adela, with an air of affected modesty,
"have ventured, subject to your criticism, to dub him
Juggernaut."</p>

<p class="indent">"H&#39;m," said Semingham, "it&#39;s a little obvious, but
not so bad for you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>MRS. DENNISON&#39;S ORDERS.</h3>

<p class="indent">Next door to Mrs. Dennison&#39;s large house in Curzon
Street there lived, in a small house, a friend of
hers, a certain Mrs. Cormack. She was a Frenchwoman,
who had been married to an Englishman, and
was now his most resigned widow. She did not pretend
to herself, or to anybody else, that Mr. Cormack&#39;s
death had been a pure misfortune, and by virtue of
her past trials&mdash;perhaps, also, of her nationality&mdash;she
was keenly awake to the seamy side of matrimony.
She would rhapsodise on the joys of an ideal marriage,
with a skilful hint of its rarity, and condemn transgressors
with a charitable reservation for insupportable
miseries. She was, she said, very romantic. Tom
Loring, however (whose evidence was tainted by an
intense dislike of her), declared that <i>affaires du c&oelig;ur</i>
interested her only when one at least of the parties
was lawfully bound to a third person; when both
were thus trammelled, the situation was ideal. But
the loves of those who were in a position to marry one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
another, and had no particular reason for not following
that legitimate path to happiness, seemed to her
(still according to Tom) dull, uninspiring&mdash;all, in fact,
that there was possible of English and stupid. She
hardly (Tom would go on, warming to his subject)
believed in them at all, and she was in the habit of regarding
wedlock merely as a condition precedent to
its own violent dissolution. Whether this unhappy
mode of looking at the matter were due to her own
peculiarities, or to those of the late Mr. Cormack,
or to those of her nation, Tom did not pretend to
say; he confined himself to denouncing it freely,
and to telling Mrs. Dennison that her next-door
neighbour was in all respects a most undesirable acquaintance;
at which outbursts Mrs. Dennison would
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison, coming out on to the balcony to
see if her carriage were in sight down the street,
found her friend close to her elbow. Their balconies
adjoined, and friendship had led to a little gate being
substituted for the usual dwarf-wall of division. Tom
Loring erected the gate into an allegory of direful
portent. Mrs. Cormack passed through it, and laid
an affectionate grasp on Maggie Dennison&#39;s arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re starting early," she remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m going a long way&mdash;right up to Hampstead.
I&#39;ve promised Harry to call on some people there."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! Who?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Their name&#39;s Carlin. He knows Mr. Carlin in
business. Mr. Carlin&#39;s a friend of Mr. Ruston&#39;s."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, of Ruston&#39;s? I like that Ruston. He is
interesting&mdash;inspiring."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is he?" said Mrs. Dennison, buttoning her glove.
"You&#39;d better marry him, Berthe."</p>

<p class="indent">"Marry him? No, indeed. I think he would
beat one."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that being inspiring? I&#39;m glad Harry&#39;s not
inspiring."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you know what I mean. He&#39;s a man
who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack threw up her arms as though praying
for the inspired word. Mrs. Dennison did not
wait for it.</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s the carriage. Good-bye, dear," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison started with a smile on her face.
Berthe was so funny; she was like a page out of a
French novel. She loved anything not quite respectable,
and peopled the world with heroes of loose
morals and overpowering wills. She adored a dominating
mind and lived in the discovery of affinities.
What nonsense it all was&mdash;so very remote from the
satisfactory humdrum of real life. One kept house,
and gave dinners, and made the children happy, and
was fond of one&#39;s husband, and life passed most&mdash;&mdash;Here
Mrs. Dennison suddenly yawned, and fell to
hoping that the Carlins would not be oppressively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
dull. She had been bored all day long; the children
had been fretful, and poor Harry was hurt and in low
spirits because of a cruel caricature in a comic paper,
and Tom Loring had scolded her for laughing at the
caricature (it hit Harry off so exactly), and nobody
had come to see her, except a wretch who had once
been her kitchenmaid, and had come to terrible grief,
and wanted to be taken back, and of course couldn&#39;t
be, and had to be sent away in tears with a sovereign,
and the tears were no use and the sovereign not much.</p>

<p class="indent">The Carlins fortunately proved tolerably interesting
in their own way. Carlin was about fifty-five&mdash;an
acute man of business, it seemed, and possessed by
an unwavering confidence in the abilities of Willie
Ruston. Mrs. Carlin was ten or fifteen years younger
than her husband&mdash;a homely little woman, with a
swarm of children. Mrs. Dennison wondered how
they all fitted into the small house, but was told that
it was larger by two good rooms than their old dwelling
in the country town, whence Willie had summoned
them to take a hand in his schemes. Willie
had not insisted on the coal business being altogether
abandoned&mdash;as Mrs. Carlin said, with a touch of
timidity, it was well to have something to fall back
upon&mdash;but he required most of Carlin&#39;s time now, and
the added work made residence in London a necessity.
In spite of Mr. Carlin&#39;s air of hard-headedness, and
his wife&#39;s prudent recognition of the business aspect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
of life, they neither of them seemed to have a will of
their own. Willie&mdash;as they both called him&mdash;was the
Providence, and the mixture of reverence and familiarity
presented her old acquaintance in a new light
to Maggie Dennison. Even the children prattled
about "Willie," and their mother&#39;s rebukes made
"Mr. Ruston" no more than a strange and transitory
effort. Mrs. Dennison wondered what there was in
the man&mdash;consulting her own recollections of him in
hope of enlightenment.</p>

<p class="indent">"He takes such broad views," said Carlin, and
seemed to find this characteristic the sufficient justification
for his faith.</p>

<p class="indent">"I used to know him very well, you know," remarked
Mrs. Dennison, anxious to reach a more
friendly footing, and realising that to connect herself
with Ruston offered the best chance of it. "I daresay
he&#39;s spoken of me&mdash;of Maggie Sherwood?"</p>

<p class="indent">They thought not, though Willie had been in Carlin&#39;s
employ at the time when he and Mrs. Dennison
parted. She was even able, by comparison of dates, to
identify the holiday in which that scene had occurred
and that sentence been spoken; but he had never
mentioned her name. She very much doubted
whether he had even thought of her. The fool and
the fool&#39;s wife had both been dismissed from his mind.
She frowned impatiently. Why should it be anything
to her if they had?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span></p>

<p class="indent">There was a commotion among the children, starting
from one who was perched on the window-sill.
Ruston himself was walking up to the door, dressed in
a light suit and a straw hat. After the greetings,
while all were busy getting him tea, he turned to Mrs.
Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is very kind of you," he said in an undertone.</p>

<p class="indent">"My husband wished me to come," she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">He seemed in good spirits. He laughed, as he
answered,</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I didn&#39;t suppose you came to please me."</p>

<p class="indent">"You spoke as if you did," said she, still trying to
resent his tone, which she thought a better guide to
the truth than his easy disclaimer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, you never did anything to please me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you ever ask me?" she retorted.</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced at her for a moment, as he began to
answer,</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, now, I don&#39;t believe I ever did; but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Carlin interposed with a proffered cup of tea,
and he broke off.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks, Mrs. Carlin. I say, Carlin, it&#39;s going
first-rate. Your husband&#39;s help&#39;s simply invaluable,
Mrs. Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry?" she said, in a tone that she regretted a
moment later, for there was a passing gleam in Ruston&#39;s
eye before he answered gravely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"His firm carries great weight. Well, we&#39;re all in
it here, sink or swim; aren&#39;t we, Carlin?"</p>

<p class="indent">Carlin nodded emphatically, and his wife gave an
anxious little sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">"And what&#39;s to be the end of it?" asked Mrs.
Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ten per cent," said Carlin, with conviction. He
could not have spoken with more utter satisfaction of
the millennium.</p>

<p class="indent">"The end?" echoed Ruston. "Oh, I don&#39;t
know."</p>

<p class="indent">"At least he won&#39;t say," said Carlin admiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison rose to go, engaging the Carlins to
dine with her&mdash;an invitation accepted with some
nervousness, until the extension of it to Ruston gave
them a wing to come under. Ruston, with that directness
of his that shamed mere dexterity and superseded
tact, bade Carlin stay where he was, and himself
escorted the visitor to her carriage. Half-way
down the garden walk she looked up at him and remarked,</p>

<p class="indent">"I expect you&#39;re the end."</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes had been wandering, but they came back
sharply to hers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then don&#39;t tell anybody," said he lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not know whether what he said amounted
to a confession or were merely a jest. The next moment
he was off at a tangent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I like your friend Miss Ferrars. She says a lot of
sharp things, and now and then something sensible."</p>

<p class="indent">"Now and then! Poor Adela!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, she doesn&#39;t often try. Besides, she&#39;s handsome."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you&#39;ve found time to notice that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I notice that first," said Mr. Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">They were at the carriage-door.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not dressed properly, so I mustn&#39;t drive with
you," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Supposing that was the only reason," she replied,
smiling, "would it stop you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because of other fools."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll take you as far as Regent&#39;s Park. The other
fools are on the other side of that."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll chance so far," and, waving his hand vaguely
towards the house, he got in. It did not seem to
occur to him that there was any want of ceremony in
his farewell to the Carlins.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose," she said, "you think most of us
fools?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve been learning to think it less and to show it
less still."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re not much changed, though."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve had some of my corners chipped off by collision
with other hard substances."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you for that &#39;other&#39;!" cried Mrs. Dennison,
with a little laugh. "They must have been very
hard ones."</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t say that they weren&#39;t a little bit injured
too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor things! I should think so."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have my human side."</p>

<p class="indent">"Generally the other side, isn&#39;t it?" she asked
with a merry glance. The talk had suddenly become
very pleasant. He laughed, and stopped the carriage.
A sigh escaped from Mrs. Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"Next time," he said, "we&#39;ll talk about you, or
Miss Ferrars, or that little Miss Marjory Valentine,
not about me. Good-bye," and he was gone before
she could say a word to him.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was natural that she should think a little
about him. She had not, she said to herself with a
weary smile, too many interesting things to think
about, and she began to find him decidedly interesting;
in which fact again she found a certain strangeness
and some material for reflection, because she
recollected very well that as a girl she had not found
him very attractive. Perhaps she demanded then
more colouring of romance than he had infused into
their intercourse; she had indeed suspected him of
suppressed romance, but the suppression had been
very thorough, betraying itself only doubtfully here
and there, as in his judgment of her accepted suitor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
Moreover, let his feelings then have been what they
might, he was not, she felt sure, the man to cherish a
fruitless love for eight or nine years, or to suffer any
resurrection of expired emotions on a renewed encounter
with an old flame. He buried his dead too
deep for that; if they were in the way, she could
fancy him sometimes shovelling the earth over them
and stamping it down without looking too curiously
whether life were actually extinct or only flickering
towards its extinction; if it were not quite gone at
the beginning of the gravedigger&#39;s work, it would be
at the end, and the result was the same. Nor did she
suppose that ghosts gibbered or clanked in the orderly
trim mansions of his brain. In fact, she was
to him a more or less pleasant acquaintance, sandwiched
in his mind between Adela Ferrars and Marjory
Valentine&mdash;with something attractive about her,
though she might lack the sparkle of the one and had
been robbed of the other&#39;s youthful freshness. This
was the conclusion which she called upon herself to
draw as she drove back from Hampstead&mdash;the plain
and sensible conclusion. Yet, as she reached Curzon
Street, there was a smile on her face; and the conclusion
was hardly such as to make her smile&mdash;unless indeed
she had added to it the reflection that it is ill
judging of things till they are finished. Her acquaintance
with Willie Ruston was not ended yet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, Maggie!" cried her husband through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
the open door of his study as she passed up-stairs.
"Great news! We&#39;re to go ahead. We settled it at
the meeting this morning."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison was in exuberant spirits. The
great company was on the verge of actual existence.
From the chrysalis of its syndicate stage it was to
issue a bright butterfly.</p>

<p class="indent">"And Ruston was most complimentary to our
house. He said he could never have carried it
through without us. He&#39;s in high feather."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison listened to more details, thinking,
as her husband talked, that Ruston&#39;s cheerful mood
was fully explained, but wondering that he had not
himself thought it worth while to explain to her the
cause of it a little more fully. With that achievement
fresh in his hand, he had been content to
hold his peace. Did he think her not worth telling?</p>

<p class="indent">With a cloud on her brow and her smile eclipsed,
she passed on to the drawing-room. The window was
open and she saw Tom Loring&#39;s back in the balcony.
Then she heard her friend Mrs. Cormack&#39;s rather
shrill voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not say such things?" the voice cried, and Mrs.
Dennison could picture the whirl of expostulatory
hands that accompanied the question. "But why
not?"</p>

<p class="indent">Tom&#39;s voice answered in the careful tones of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
man who is trying not to lose his temper, or, anyhow,
to conceal the loss.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, apart from anything else, suppose Dennison
heard you? It wouldn&#39;t be over-pleasant for
him."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison stood still, slowly peeling off her
gloves.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, the poor man! I would not like to hurt
him. I will be silent. Oh, he does his very best!
But you can&#39;t help it."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison stepped a yard nearer the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"Help what?" asked Tom in the deepest exasperation,
no longer to be hidden.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, what must happen? It must be that the
true man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">A smile flickered over Maggie Dennison&#39;s face.
How like Berthe! But whence came this topic?</p>

<p class="indent">"Nonsense, I tell you!" cried Tom with a stamp
of his foot.</p>

<p class="indent">And at the sound Mrs. Dennison smiled again,
and drew yet nearer to the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, it&#39;s always nonsense what I say! Well, we
shall see, Mr. Loring," and Mrs. Cormack tripped in
through her window, and wrote in her diary&mdash;she
kept a diary full of reflections&mdash;that Englishmen
were all stupid. She had written that before, but
the deep truth bore repetition.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom went in too, and found himself face to face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
with Mrs. Dennison. Bright spots of colour glowed
on her cheeks; had she answered the question of the
origin of the topic? Tom blushed and looked furtively at her.</p>

<p class="indent">"So the great scheme is launched," she remarked,
"and Mr. Ruston triumphs!"</p>

<p class="indent">Tom&#39;s manner betrayed intense relief, but he was
still perturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;re having a precious lot of Ruston," he observed,
leaning against the mantelpiece and putting
his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>I</i> like him," said Maggie Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"Those are the orders, are they?" asked Tom
with a rather wry smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she answered, smiling at Tom&#39;s smile. It
amused her when he put her manner into words.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then we all like him," said Tom, and, feeling
quite secure now, he added, "Mrs. Cormack said we
should, which is rather against him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Berthe&#39;s a silly woman. Never mind her.
Harry likes him too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Lucky for Ruston he does. Your husband&#39;s a
useful friend. I fancy most of Ruston&#39;s friends are
of the useful variety."</p>

<p class="indent">"And why shouldn&#39;t we be useful to him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"On the contrary, it seems our destiny," grumbled
Tom, whose destiny appeared not to please him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>TWO YOUNG GENTLEMEN.</h3>

<p class="indent">Lady Valentine was the widow of a baronet of
good family and respectable means; the one was to
be continued and the other absorbed by her son,
young Sir Walter, now an Oxford undergraduate and
just turned twenty-one years of age. Lady Valentine
had a jointure, and Marjory a pretty face. The remaining
family assets were a country-house of moderate
dimensions in the neighbourhood of Maidenhead,
and a small flat in Cromwell Road. Lady Valentine
deplored the rise of the plutocracy, and had sometimes
secretly hoped that a plutocrat would marry her
daughter. In other respects she was an honest and
unaffected woman.</p>

<p class="indent">Young Sir Walter, however, had his own views for
his sister, and young Sir Walter, when he surveyed
the position which the laws and customs of the realm
gave him, was naturally led to suppose that his opinion
had some importance. He was hardly responsible
for the error, and very probably Mr. Ruston would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
have been better advised had his bearing towards the
young man not indicated so very plainly that the error
was an error. But in the course of the visits to Cromwell
Road, which Ruston found time to pay in the
intervals of floating the Omofaga Company&mdash;and he
was a man who found time for many things&mdash;this
impression of his made itself tolerably evident, and,
consequently, Sir Walter entertained grave doubts
whether Ruston were a gentleman. And, if a fellow
is not a gentleman, what, he asked, do brains and all
the rest of it go for? Moreover, how did the chap
live? To which queries Marjory answered that "Oxford
boys" were very silly&mdash;a remark which embittered,
without in the least elucidating, the question.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost everybody has one disciple who looks up
to him as master and mentor, and, ill as he was suited
to such a post, Evan Haselden filled it for Walter
Valentine. Evan had been in his fourth year when
Walter was a freshman, and the reverence engendered
in those days had been intensified when Evan had
become, first, secretary to a minister and then, as he
showed diligence and aptitude, a member of Parliament.
Evan was a strong Tory, but payment of
members had an unholy attraction for him; this indication
of his circumstances may suffice. Men thought
him a promising youth, women called him a nice boy,
and young Sir Walter held him for a statesman and a
man of the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Seeing that what Sir Walter wanted was an unfavourable
opinion of Ruston, he could not have done
better than consult his respected friend. Juggernaut&mdash;Adela
Ferrars was pleased with the nickname, and
it began to be repeated&mdash;had been crushing Evan
in one or two little ways lately, and he did it with an
unconsciousness that increased the brutality. Besides
displacing him from the position he wished to occupy
at more than one social gathering, Ruston, being in
the Lobby of the House one day (perhaps on Omofaga
business), had likened the pretty (it was his epithet)
young member, as he sped with a glass of water to his
party leader, to Ganymede in a frock coat&mdash;a description,
Evan felt, injurious to a serious politician.</p>

<p class="indent">"A gentleman?" he said, in reply to young Sir
Walter&#39;s inquiry. "Well, everybody&#39;s a gentleman
now, so I suppose Ruston is."</p>

<p class="indent">"I call him an unmannerly brute," observed Walter,
"and I can&#39;t think why mother and Marjory are
so civil to him."</p>

<p class="indent">Evan shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"You meet the fellow everywhere," he sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Such an ugly mug as he&#39;s got too," pursued
young Sir Walter. "But Marjory says it&#39;s full of
character."</p>

<p class="indent">"Character! I should think so. Enough to hang
him on sight," said Evan bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s been a lot to our place. Marjory seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
like him. I say, Haselden, do you remember what
you spoke of after dinner at the Savoy the other
day?"</p>

<p class="indent">Evan nodded, looking rather embarrassed; indeed
he blushed, and little as he liked doing that, it became
him very well.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you mean it? Because, you know, I should
like it awfully."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks, Val, old man. Oh, rather, I meant it."</p>

<p class="indent">Young Sir Walter lowered his voice and looked
cautiously round&mdash;they were in the club smoking-room.</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I thought, you know, that you were
rather&mdash;you know&mdash;Adela Ferrars?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing in that, only <i>pour passer le temps</i>,"
Evan assured him with that superb man-of-the-worldliness.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a pity that Adela could not hear him. But
there was more to follow.</p>

<p class="indent">"The truth is," resumed Evan&mdash;"and, of course, I
rely on your discretion, Val&mdash;I thought there might
be a&mdash;an obstacle."</p>

<p class="indent">Young Sir Walter looked knowing.</p>

<p class="indent">"When you were good enough to suggest what you
did&mdash;about your sister&mdash;I doubted for a moment how
such a thing would be received by&mdash;well, at a certain
house."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I shouldn&#39;t wonder if you could guess."</p>

<p class="indent">"N&mdash;no, I don&#39;t think so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, it doesn&#39;t matter where."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but I say, you might as well tell me. Hang
it, I&#39;ve learnt to hold my tongue."</p>

<p class="indent">"You hadn&#39;t noticed it? That&#39;s all right. I&#39;m
glad to hear it," said Evan, whose satisfaction was not
conspicuous in his tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m so little in town, you see," said Walter tactfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well&mdash;for heaven&#39;s sake, don&#39;t let it go any farther&mdash;Curzon
Street."</p>

<p class="indent">"What! Of course! Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, yes. But I&#39;ve made up my mind. I
shall drop all that. Best, isn&#39;t it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Walter nodded a sagacious assent.</p>

<p class="indent">"There was never anything in it, really," said
Evan, and he was not displeased with his friend&#39;s incredulous
expression. It is a great luxury to speak
the truth and yet not be believed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, what you propose," continued Evan, "is
most&mdash;but, I say, Val, what does she think?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She likes you&mdash;and you&#39;ll have all my influence,"
said the Head of the Family in a tone of importance.</p>

<p class="indent">"But how do you know she likes me?" insisted
Evan, whose off-hand air gave place to a manner betraying
some trepidation.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know for certain, of course. And, I say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Haselden, I believe mother&#39;s got an idea in her head
about that fellow Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">"The devil! That brute! Oh, hang it, Val, she
can&#39;t&mdash;your sister, I mean&mdash;I tell you what, I shan&#39;t
play the fool any longer."</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Walter cordially approved of increased activity,
and the two young gentlemen, having settled one
lady&#39;s future and disposed of the claims of two others
to their complete satisfaction, betook themselves to
recreation.</p>

<p class="indent">Evan was not, however, of opinion that anything
in the conversation above recorded, imposed upon him
the obligation of avoiding entirely Mrs. Dennison&#39;s
society. On the contrary, he took an early opportunity
of going to see her. His attitude towards her
was one of considerably greater deference than Sir
Walter understood it to be, and he had a high idea of
the value of her assistance. And he did not propose
to deny himself such savour of sentiment as the lady
would allow; and she generally allowed a little. He
intended to say nothing about Ruston, but as it happened
that Mrs. Dennison&#39;s wishes set in an opposing
direction, he had not been long in the drawing room
at Curzon Street before he found himself again with
the name of his enemy on his lips. He spoke with refreshing
frankness and an engaging confidence in his
hostess&#39; sympathy. Mrs. Dennison had no difficulty in
seeing that he had a special reason for his bitterness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Is it only because he called you Ganymede? And
it&#39;s a very good name for you, Mr. Haselden."</p>

<p class="indent">To be compared to Ganymede in private by a lady
and in public by a scoffer, are things very different.
Evan smiled complacently.</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s more than that, isn&#39;t there?" asked Mrs.
Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">Evan admitted that there was more, and, in obedience
to some skilful guidance, he revealed what there
was more&mdash;what beyond mere offended dignity&mdash;between
himself and Mr. Ruston. He had to complain
of no lack of interest on the part of his listener. Mrs.
Dennison questioned him closely as to his grounds for
anticipating Ruston&#39;s rivalry. The idea was evidently
quite new to her; and Evan was glad to detect her reluctance
to accept it&mdash;she must think as he did about
Willie Ruston. The tangible evidence appeared on
examination reassuringly small, and Evan, by a strange
conversion, found himself driven to defend his apprehensions
by insisting on just that power of attraction
in his foe which he had begun by denying altogether.
But that, Mrs. Dennison objected, only showed, even
if it existed, that Marjory might like Ruston, not that
Ruston would return her liking. On the whole Mrs.
Dennison comforted him, and, dismissing Ruston
from the discussion, said with a smile,</p>

<p class="indent">"So you&#39;re thinking of settling down already, are
you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I say, Mrs. Dennison, you&#39;ve always been awfully
good to me; I wonder if you&#39;d help me in this?"</p>

<p class="indent">"How could I help you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, lots of ways. Well, for instance, old Lady
Valentine doesn&#39;t ask me there often. You see, I
haven&#39;t got any money."</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor boy! Of course you haven&#39;t. Nice young
men never have any money."</p>

<p class="indent">"So I don&#39;t get many chances of seeing her."</p>

<p class="indent">"And I might arrange meetings for you? That&#39;s
how I could help? Now, why should I help?"</p>

<p class="indent">Evan was encouraged by this last question, put in
his friend&#39;s doubtfully-serious doubtfully-playful manner.</p>

<p class="indent">"It needn&#39;t," he said, in a tone rather more timid
than young Sir Walter would have expected, "make
any difference to our friendship, need it? If it meant
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The sentence was left in expressive incompleteness.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison wanted to laugh; but why should
she hurt his feelings? He was a pleasant boy, and, in
spite of his vanity, really a clever one. He had been
a little spoilt; that was all. She turned her laugh in
another direction.</p>

<p class="indent">"Berthe Cormack would tell you that it would be
sure to intensify it," she said. "Seriously, I shan&#39;t
hate you for marrying, and I don&#39;t suppose Marjory
will hate me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Then" (Mrs. Dennison had to smile at that little
word), "you&#39;ll help me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps," said Mrs. Dennison, allowing her smile
to become manifest.</p>

<p class="indent">"You won&#39;t be against me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps not."</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye," said Evan, pressing her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">He had enjoyed himself very much, and Mrs. Dennison
was glad that she had been good-natured, and
had not laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye, and I hope you&#39;ll be very happy, if you
succeed. And&mdash;Evan&mdash;don&#39;t kill Mr. Ruston!"</p>

<p class="indent">The laugh came at last, but he was out of the door
in time, and Mrs. Dennison had no leisure to enjoy it
fully, for, the moment her visitor was gone, Mr. Belford
and Lord Semingham were announced. They
came together, seeking Harry Dennison. There was
a "little hitch" of some sort in the affairs of the
Omofaga Company&mdash;nothing of consequence, said Mr.
Belford reassuringly. Mrs. Dennison explained that
Harry Dennison had gone off to call on Mr. Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, then he knows by now," said Semingham in
a tone of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">"And it&#39;ll be all right," added Belford contentedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Belford," said Mrs. Dennison, "I&#39;m living in
an atmosphere of Omofaga. I eat it, and drink it, and
wear it, and breathe it. And, what in the end, is it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Ask Ruston," interposed Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"I did; but I don&#39;t think he told me."</p>

<p class="indent">"But surely, my dear Mrs. Dennison, your husband
takes you into his confidence?" suggested Mr.
Belford.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison smiled, as she replied,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes, I know what you&#39;re doing. But I want
to know why you&#39;re doing it. I don&#39;t believe you&#39;ll
ever get anything out of it, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, directors always get something," protested
Semingham. "Penal servitude sometimes, but always
something."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve never had such implicit faith in any undertaking
in my life," asserted Mr. Belford. "And I
know that your husband shares my views. It&#39;s bound
to be the greatest success of the day. Ah, here&#39;s
Dennison!"</p>

<p class="indent">Harry came in wiping his brow. Belford rushed
to him, and drew him to the window, button-holing
him with decision. Lord Semingham smiled lazily
and pulled his whisker.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t you want to hear the news?" Mrs. Dennison
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"No! He&#39;s been to Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison looked at him for an instant with
something rather like scorn in her eye. Lord Semingham
laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not quite as bad as that, really," he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"And the others?" she asked, leaning forward and
taking care that her voice did not reach the other pair.</p>

<p class="indent">"He turns Belford round his fingers."</p>

<p class="indent">"And Mr. Carlin?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In his pocket."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison cast a glance towards the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t go on," implored Semingham, half-seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">"And my husband?" she asked in a still lower
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham protested with a gesture against
such cross-examination.</p>

<p class="indent">"Surely it&#39;s a good thing for me to know?" she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well&mdash;a great influence."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause for an instant. Then she rose
with a laugh and rang the bell for tea.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope he won&#39;t ruin us all," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve got Bessie&#39;s settlement," observed Lord
Semingham; and he added after a moment&#39;s pause,
"What&#39;s the matter? I thought you were a thoroughgoing
believer."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m a woman," she answered. "If I were a
man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;d be the prophet, not the disciple, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him, and then across to the couple
by the window.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"To do Belford justice," remarked Semingham,
reading her glance, "he never admits that he isn&#39;t a
great man&mdash;though surely he must know it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it better to know it, or not to know it?" she
asked, restlessly fingering the teapot and cups which
had been placed before her. "I sometimes think that
if you resolutely refuse to know it, you can alter it."</p>

<p class="indent">Belford&#39;s name had been the only name mentioned
in the conversation; yet Semingham knew that she
was not thinking of Belford nor of him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I knew it about myself very soon," he said. "It
makes a man better to know it, Mrs. Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes&mdash;better," she answered impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">The two men came and joined them. Belford
accepted a cup of tea, and, as he took it, he said to
Harry, continuing their conversation,</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course, I know his value; but, after all, we
must judge for ourselves."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course," acquiesced Harry, handing him
bread-and-butter.</p>

<p class="indent">"We are the masters," pursued Belford.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison glanced at him, and a smile so full
of meaning&mdash;of meaning which it was as well Mr.
Belford should not see&mdash;appeared on her face, that
Lord Semingham deftly interposed his person between
them, and said, with apparent seriousness,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, he mustn&#39;t think he can do just what he
likes with us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I am entirely of your opinion," said Belford, with
a weighty nod.</p>

<p class="indent">After tea, Lord Semingham walked slowly back to
his own house. He had a trick of stopping still, when
he fell into thought, and he was motionless on the
pavement of Piccadilly more than once on his way
home. The last time he paused for nearly three minutes,
till an acquaintance, passing by, clapped him on
the back, and inquired what occupied his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">"I was thinking," said Semingham, laying his
forefinger on his friend&#39;s arm, "that if you take what
a clever man really is, and add to it what a clever
woman who is interested in him thinks he is, you get
a most astonishing person."</p>

<p class="indent">The friend stared. The speculation seemed hardly
pressing enough to excuse a man for blocking the
pavement of Piccadilly.</p>

<p class="indent">"If, on the other hand," pursued Semingham,
"you take what an ordinary man isn&#39;t, and add all
that a clever woman thinks he isn&#39;t, you get&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hadn&#39;t we better go on, old fellow?" asked the
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I think we&#39;d better not," said Semingham,
starting to walk again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>A TELEGRAM TO FRANKFORT.</h3>

<p class="indent">The success of Lady Valentine&#39;s Saturday to
Monday party at Maidenhead was spoilt by the unscrupulous,
or (if the charitable view be possible) the
muddle-headed conduct of certain eminent African
chiefs&mdash;so small is the world, so strong the chain of
gold (or shares) that binds it together. The party
was marred by Willie Ruston&#39;s absence; and he was
away because he had to go to Frankfort, and he had
to go to Frankfort because of that little hitch in the
affairs of the Omofaga. The hitch was, in truth, a
somewhat grave one, and it occurred, most annoyingly,
immediately after a gathering, marked by uncommon
enthusiasm and composed of highly influential
persons, had set the impress of approval on the
scheme. On the following morning, it was asserted
that the said African chiefs, from whom Ruston and
his friends derived their title to Omofaga, had acted
in a manner that belied the character for honesty and
simplicity in commercial matters (existing side by side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
with intense savagery and cruelty in social and political
life) that Mr. Foster Belford had attributed to
them at the great meeting. They had, it was said,
sold Omofaga several times over in small parcels, and
twice, at least, <i>en bloc</i>&mdash;once to the Syndicate (from
whom the Company was acquiring it) and once to an
association of German capitalists. The writer of the
article, who said that he knew the chiefs well, went so
far as to maintain that any person provided with a
few guns and a dozen or so bottles of ardent spirits
could return from Omofaga with a portmanteau full
of treaties, and this facility in obtaining the article
could not, in accordance with the law of supply and
demand, do other than gravely affect the value of it.
Willie Ruston was inclined to make light of this disclosure;
indeed, he attributed it to a desire&mdash;natural but
unprincipled&mdash;on the part of certain persons to obtain
Omofaga shares at less than their high intrinsic value;
he called it a "bear dodge" and sundry other opprobrious
names, and snapped his fingers at all possible
treaties in the world except his own. Once let him
set his foot in Omofaga, and short would be the shrift
of rival claims, supposing them to exist at all! But
the great house of Dennison, Sons &amp; Company, could
not go on in this happy-go-lucky fashion&mdash;so the
senior partner emphatically told Harry Dennison&mdash;they
were already, in his opinion, deep enough in this
affair; if they were to go any deeper, this matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
the association of German capitalists must be inquired
into. The house had not only its money, but its
credit and reputation to look after; it could not touch
any doubtful business, nor could it be left with a
block of Omofagas on its hands. In effect they were
trusting too much to this Mr. Ruston, for he, and he
alone, was their security in the matter. Not another
step would the house move till the German capitalists
were dissolved into thin air. So Willie Ruston packed
his portmanteau&mdash;likely enough the very one that had
carried the treaties away from Omofaga&mdash;and went to
Frankfort to track the German capitalists to their
lair. Meanwhile, the issue of the Omofaga was postponed,
and Mr. Carlin was set a-telegraphing to
Africa.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it also happened that, contrary to her fixed
intention, Lady Valentine was left with a bedroom to
spare, and with no just or producible reason whatever
for refusing her son&#39;s request that Evan Haselden
might occupy it. This, perhaps, should, in the view
of all true lovers, be regarded as an item on the credit
side of the African chiefs&#39; account, though in the
hostess&#39; eyes it aggravated their offence. Adela
Ferrars, Mr. Foster Belford and Tom Loring, who
positively blessed the African chiefs, were the remaining
guests.</p>

<p class="indent">All parties cannot be successful, and, if truth be
told, this of Lady Valentine&#39;s was no conspicuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
triumph. Belford and Loring quarrelled about Omofaga,
for Loring feared (he used that word) that there
might be a good deal in the German treaties, and
Belford was loud-mouthed in declaring there could
be nothing. Marjory and her brother had a "row"
because Marjory, on the Saturday afternoon, would
not go out in the Canadian canoe with Evan, but insisted
on taking a walk with Mr. Belford and hearing
all about Omofaga. Finally, Adela and Tom Loring
had a rather serious dissension because&mdash;well, just
because Tom was so intolerably stupid and narrow-minded
and rude. That was Adela&#39;s own account of
it, given in her own words, which seems pretty good
authority.</p>

<p class="indent">The unfortunate discussion began with an expression
of opinion from Tom. They were lounging very
comfortably down stream in a broad-bottomed boat.
It was a fine still evening and a lovely sunset. It
was then most wanton of Tom&mdash;even although he
couched his remark in a speciously general form&mdash;to
say,</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder at fellows who spend their life worming
money out of other people for wild-cat schemes
instead of taking to some honest trade."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. Then Adela fitted her glasses
on her nose, and observed, with a careful imitation of
Tom&#39;s forms of expression,</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder at fellows who drift through life in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
subordinate positions without the&mdash;the <i>spunk</i>&mdash;to try
and do anything for themselves."</p>

<p class="indent">"Women have no idea of honesty."</p>

<p class="indent">"Men are such jealous creatures."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not jealous of him," Tom blurted out.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of who?" asked Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">She was keeping the cooler of the pair.</p>

<p class="indent">"Confound those beastly flies," said Tom, peevishly.
There was a fly or two about, but Adela smiled
in a superior way. "I suppose I&#39;ve some right to
express an opinion," continued Tom. "You know
what I feel about the Dennisons, and&mdash;well, it&#39;s not
only the Dennisons."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! the Valentines?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Blow the Valentines!" said Tom, very ungratefully,
inasmuch as he sat in their boat and had eaten
their bread.</p>

<p class="indent">He bent over his sculls, and Adela looked at him
with a doubtful little smile. She thought Tom Loring,
on the whole, the best man she knew, the truest
and loyalest; but, these qualities are not everything,
and it seemed as if he meant to be secretary to Harry
Dennison all his life. Of course he had no money,
there was that excuse; but to some men want of
money is a reason, not for doing nothing, but for attempting
everything; it had struck Willie Ruston in
that light. Therefore she was at times angry with Tom&mdash;and
all the more angry the more she admired him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"You do me the honour to be anxious on my account?"
she asked very stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent">"He asked me how much money you had the other
day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you&#39;re insufferable; you really are. Do you
always tell women that men care only for their
money?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s not a bad thing to tell them when it&#39;s true."</p>

<p class="indent">"I call this the very vulgarest dispute I was ever
entrapped into."</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s not my fault. It&#39;s&mdash;&mdash;Hullo!"</p>

<p class="indent">His attention was arrested by Lady Valentine&#39;s
footman, who stood on the bank, calling "Mr. Loring,
sir," and holding up a telegram.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank goodness, we&#39;re interrupted," said Adela.
"Row ashore, Mr. Loring."</p>

<p class="indent">Loring obeyed, and took his despatch. It was
from Harry Dennison, and he read it aloud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Can you come up? News from Frankfort."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"I must go," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes. If you&#39;re not there, Mr. Ruston will do
something dreadful, won&#39;t he? I should like to come
too. News from Frankfort would be more interesting
than views from Mr. Belford."</p>

<p class="indent">They parted without any approach towards a
reconciliation. Tom was hopelessly sulky, Adela
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
persistently flippant. The shadow of Omofaga lay
heavy on Lady Valentine&#39;s party, and still shrouded
Tom Loring on his way to town.</p>

<p class="indent">The important despatch from Frankfort had come
in cipher, and when Tom arrived in Curzon Street, he
found Mr. Carlin, who had been sent for to read it,
just leaving the house. The men nodded to one
another, and Carlin hastily exclaimed,</p>

<p class="indent">"You must reassure Dennison! You can do it!"
and leapt into a hansom.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom smiled. If the progress of Omofaga depended
on encouragement from him, Omofaga would
remain in primitive barbarism, though missionaries
fell thick as the leaves in autumn.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison was walking up and down the
library; his hair was roughened and his appearance
indicative of much unrest; his wife sat in an armchair,
looking at him and listening to Lord Semingham,
who, poising a cigarette between his fingers, was
putting, or trying to put, a meaning to Ruston&#39;s
message.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Position critical. Must act at once. Will you
give me a free hand? If not, wire how far I
may go."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">That was how it ran when faithfully interpreted
by Mr. Carlin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"You see," observed Lord Semingham, "it&#39;s clearly
a matter of money."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course it is," said he; "it&#39;s not likely to be
a question of anything else."</p>

<p class="indent">"Therefore the Germans have something worth
paying for," continued Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," amended Tom, "something Ruston thinks
it worth his while to pay for, anyhow."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is to say they have treaties touching, or
purporting to touch, Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"And," added Harry Dennison, who did not lack
a certain business shrewdness, "probably their Government
behind them to some extent."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom flung himself into a chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"The thing&#39;s monstrous," he pronounced. "Semingham
and you, Dennison, are, besides himself&mdash;and
he&#39;s got nothing&mdash;the only people responsible up to
now. And he asks you to give him an unlimited
credit without giving you a word of information!
It&#39;s the coolest thing I ever heard of in all my life."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course he means the Company to pay in the
end," Semingham reminded the hostile critic.</p>

<p class="indent">"Time enough to talk of the Company when we
see it," retorted Tom, with an aggressive scepticism.</p>

<p class="indent">"Position critical! Hum. I suppose their treaties
must be worth something," pursued Semingham.
"Dennison, I can&#39;t be drained dry over this job."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison shook his head in a puzzled
fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Carlin says it&#39;s all right," he remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course he does!" exclaimed Tom impatiently.
"Two and two make five for him if Ruston says they
do."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Tom, what&#39;s your advice?" asked Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must tell him to do nothing till he&#39;s seen
you, or at least sent you full details of the position."</p>

<p class="indent">The two men nodded. Mrs. Dennison rose from
her chair, walked to the window, and stood looking
out.</p>

<p class="indent">"Loring just confirms what I thought," said
Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"He says he must act at once," Harry reminded
them; he was still wavering, and, as he spoke, he
glanced uneasily at his wife; but there was nothing
to show that she even heard the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, he hates referring to anybody," said Tom.
"He&#39;s to have a free hand, and you&#39;re to pay the bill.
That&#39;s his programme, and a very pretty one it is&mdash;for
him."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom&#39;s <i>animus</i> was apparent, and Lord Semingham
laughed gently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Still, you&#39;re right in substance," he conceded
when the laugh was ended, and as he spoke he drew
a sheet of notepaper towards him and took up a pen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;d better settle just what to say," he observed.
"Carlin will be back in half an hour, and we promised
to have it ready for him. What you suggest seems all
right, Loring."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom nodded. Harry Dennison stood stock still
for an instant and then said, with a sigh,</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose so. He&#39;ll be furious&mdash;and I hope to
God we shan&#39;t lose the whole thing."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham&#39;s pen-point was in actual touch
with the paper before him, when Mrs. Dennison suddenly
turned round and faced them. She rested one
hand on the window-sash, and held the other up in a
gesture which demanded attention.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you really going to back out now?" she
asked in a very quiet voice, but with an intonation of
contempt that made all the three men raise their
heads with the jerk of startled surprise. Lord Semingham
checked the movement of his pen, and leant
back in his chair, looking at her. Her face was a
little flushed and she was breathing quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear," said Harry Dennison very apologetically,
"do you think you quite understand&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">But Tom Loring&#39;s patience was exhausted. His
interview with Adela left him little reserve of toleration;
and the discovery of another and even worse
case of Rustomania utterly overpowered his discretion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Dennison," he said, "wants us to deliver
ourselves, bound hand and foot, to this fellow."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, and if I do?" she demanded, turning on
him. "Can&#39;t you even follow, when you&#39;ve found a
man who can lead?"</p>

<p class="indent">And then, conscious perhaps of having been
goaded to an excess of warmth by Tom&#39;s open scorn,
she turned her face away.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lead, yes! Lead us to ruin!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"You won&#39;t be ruined, anyhow," she retorted
quickly, facing round on him again, reckless in her
anger how she might wound him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom&#39;s anxious for us, Maggie," her husband reminded
her, and he laid his hand on Tom Loring&#39;s
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom&#39;s excitement was not to be soothed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why are we all to be his instruments?" he demanded
angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should be proud to be," she said haughtily.</p>

<p class="indent">Her husband smiled in an uneasy effort after nonchalance,
and Lord Semingham shot a quick glance
at her out of his observant eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should be proud of a friend like you if I were
Ruston," he said gently, hoping to smooth matters a
little.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison ignored his attempt.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can&#39;t you see?" she asked. "Can&#39;t you see
that he&#39;s a man to&mdash;to do things? It&#39;s enough for us
if we can help him."</p>

<p class="indent">She had forgotten her embarrassment; she spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
half in contempt, half in entreaty, wholly in an earnest
urgency, that made her unconscious of any
strangeness in her zeal. Harry looked uncomfortable.
Semingham with a sigh blew a cloud of smoke from
his cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom Loring sat silent. He stretched out his legs
to their full length, rested the nape of his neck on the
chair-back, and stared up at the ceiling. His attitude
eloquently and most rudely asserted folly&mdash;almost
lunacy&mdash;in Mrs. Dennison. She noticed it and her
eyes flashed, but she did not speak to him. She
looked at Semingham and surprised an expression in
his eyes that made her drop her own for an instant;
she knew very well what he was thinking&mdash;what a
man like him would think. But she recovered herself
and met his glance boldly.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison sat down and slowly rubbed his
brow with his handkerchief. Lord Semingham took
up the pen and balanced it between his fingers.
There was silence in the room for full three minutes.
Then came a loud knock at the hall door.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s Carlin," said Harry Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">No one else spoke, and for another moment there
was silence. The steps of the butler and the visitor
were already audible in the hall when Lord Semingham,
with his own shrug and his own smile, as though
nothing in the world were worth so much dispute or
so much bitterness, said to Dennison,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Hang it! Shall we chance it, Harry?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison made one swift step forward towards
him, her face all alight; but she stopped before
she reached the table and turned to her husband.
At the moment Carlin was announced. He
entered with a rush of eagerness. Tom Loring did
not move. Semingham wrote on his paper,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Use your discretion, but make every effort to
keep down expenses. Wire progress."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"Will that do?" he asked, handing the paper to
Harry Dennison and leaning back with a smile on his
face; and, though he handed the paper to Harry, he
looked at Mrs. Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison was standing by her husband now,
her arm through his. As he read she read also.
Then she took the paper from his yielding hand and
came and bent over the table, shoulder to shoulder
with Lord Semingham. Taking the pen from
his fingers, she dipped it in the ink, and with a firm
dash she erased all save the first three words of the
message. This done, she looked round into Semingham&#39;s
face with a smile of triumph.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, it&#39;ll be cheap to send, anyhow," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">He got up and motioned Carlin to take his place.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison walked back to the window, and he
followed her there. They heard Carlin&#39;s cry of delight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
and Harry Dennison beginning to make excuses
and trying to find business reasons for what had
been done. Suddenly Tom Loring leapt to his feet
and strode swiftly out of the room, slamming the door
behind him. Mrs. Dennison heard the sound with a
smile of content. She seemed to have no misgivings
and no regrets.</p>

<p class="indent">"Really," said Lord Semingham, sticking his eye-glass
in his eye and regarding her closely, "you ought
to be the Queen of Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">With her slim fingers she began to drum gently
on the window-pane.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think there&#39;s a king already," she said, looking
out into the street.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes, a king," he answered with a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison looked round. He did not stop
laughing, and presently she laughed just a little herself.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, of course, it&#39;s always that in a woman, isn&#39;t
it?" she asked sarcastically.</p>

<p class="indent">"Generally," he answered, unashamed.</p>

<p class="indent">She grew grave, and looked in his face almost&mdash;so
it seemed to him&mdash;as though she sought there an
answer to something that puzzled her. He gave her
none. She sighed and drummed on the window
again; then she turned to him with a sudden bright
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t care; I&#39;m glad I did it," she said defiantly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>WHOSE SHALL IT BE?</h3>

<p class="indent">Probably no one is always wrong; at any rate,
Mr. Otto Heather was right now and then, and he
had hit the mark when he accused Willie Ruston of
"commercialism." But he went astray when he concluded,
<i>per saltum</i>, that the object of his antipathy
was a money-grubbing, profit-snatching, upper-hand-getting
machine, and nothing else in the world.
Probably, again, no one ever was. Ruston had not
only feelings, but also what many people consider a
later development&mdash;a conscience. And, whatever the
springs on which his conscience moved, it acted as a
restraint upon him. Both his feelings and his conscience
would have told him that it would not do for
him to delude his friends or the public with a scheme
which was a fraud. He would have delivered this
inner verdict in calm and temperate terms; it would
have been accompanied by no disgust, no remorse, no
revulsion at the idea having made its way into his
mind; it was just that, on the whole, such a thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
wouldn&#39;t do. The vagueness of the phrase faithfully
embodied the spirit of the decision, for whether it
wouldn&#39;t do, because it was in itself unseemly, or
merely because, if found out, it would look unseemly,
was precisely one of those curious points with which
Mr. Ruston&#39;s practical intellect declined to trouble
itself. If Omofaga had been a fraud, then Ruston
would have whistled it down the wind. But Omofaga
was no fraud&mdash;in his hands at least no fraud. For,
while he believed in Omofaga to a certain extent,
Willie Ruston believed in himself to an indefinite,
perhaps an infinite, extent. He thought Omofaga a
fair security for anyone&#39;s money, but himself a superb
one. Omofaga without him&mdash;or other people&#39;s Omofagas&mdash;might
be a promising speculation; add him,
and Omofaga became a certainty. It will be seen,
then, that Mr. Heather&#39;s inspiration had soon failed&mdash;unless,
that is, machines can see visions and dream
dreams, and melt down hard facts in crucibles heated
to seven times in the fires of imagination. But a
man may do all this, and yet not be the passive victim
of his dreams and imaginings. The old buccaneers&mdash;and
Adela Ferrars had thought Ruston a buccaneer
modernised&mdash;dreamt, but they sailed and fought too;
and they sailed and fought and won because they
dreamt. And if many of their dreams were tinted
with the gleam of gold, they were none the less
powerful and alluring for that.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Ruston had laid the whole position before Baron
von Geltschmidt of Frankfort, with&mdash;as it seemed&mdash;the
utmost candour. He and his friends were not
deeply committed in the matter; there was, as yet,
only a small syndicate; of course they had paid something
for their rights, but, as the Baron knew (and
Willie&#39;s tone emphasised the fact that he must know)
the actual sums paid out of pocket in these cases
were not of staggering magnitude; no company was
formed yet; none would be, unless all went smoothly.
If the Baron and his friends were sure of their
ground, and preferred to go on&mdash;why, he and his
friends were not eager to commit themselves to a long
and arduous contest. There must, he supposed, be a
give-and-take between them.</p>

<p class="indent">"It looks," he said, "as far as I can judge, as if
either we should have to buy you out, or you would
have to buy us out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps," suggested the Baron, blinking lazily
behind his gold spectacles, "we could get rid of you
without buying you out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, if you drove us to it, by refusing to treat, we
should have a shot at that too, of course," laughed Willie
Ruston, swallowing a glass of white wine. The Baron
had asked him to discuss the matter over luncheon.</p>

<p class="indent">"It seems to me," observed the Baron, lighting a
cigar, "that people are rather cold about speculations
just now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I should think so; but this is not a speculation;
it&#39;s a certainty."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why do you tell me that, when you want to get
rid of me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because you won&#39;t believe it. Wasn&#39;t that Bismarck&#39;s
way?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are not Bismarck&mdash;and a certainty is what
the public thinks one."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that philosophy or finance?" asked Ruston,
laughing again.</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron, who had in his day loved both the
subjects referred to, drank a glass of wine and
chuckled as he delivered himself of the following doctrine:</p>

<p class="indent">"What the public thinks a certainty, is a certainty
for the public&mdash;that would be philosophy, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe so. I never read much, and your extract
doesn&#39;t raise my idea of its value."</p>

<p class="indent">"But what the public thinks a certainty, is a certainty&mdash;for
the promotors&mdash;that is finance. You see
the difference is simple."</p>

<p class="indent">"And the distinction luminous. This, Baron,
seems to be the age of finance."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, well, there are still honest men," said the
Baron, with the optimism of age.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I&#39;m one&mdash;and you&#39;re another."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m much obliged. You&#39;ve been in Omofaga?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes. And you haven&#39;t, Baron."</p>

<p class="indent">"Friends of mine have."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. They came just after I left."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron knew that this statement was true.
As his study of Willie Ruston progressed, he became
inclined to think that it might be important. Mere
right (so far as such a thing could be given by prior
treaties) was not of much moment; but right and
Ruston together might be formidable. Now the
Baron (and his friends were friends much in the way,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, that Mr. Wagg and Mr. Wenham
were friends of the Marquis of Steyne, and may therefore
drop out of consideration) was old and rich, and,
by consequence, at a great disadvantage with a man
who was young and poor.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t see the bearing of that," he observed,
having paused for a moment to consider all its bearings.</p>

<p class="indent">"It means that you can&#39;t have Omofaga," said
Willie Ruston. "You were too late, you see."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron smoked and drank and laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re a young fool, my boy&mdash;or something quite
different," said he, laying a hand on his companion&#39;s
arm. Then he asked suddenly, "What about Dennisons?"</p>

<p class="indent">"They&#39;re behind me if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you&#39;re not in front of me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"But if I am, my son?" asked the Baron, almost
caressingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I leave for Omofaga by the next boat."</p>

<p class="indent">"Eh! And for what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind what. You&#39;ll find out when you
come."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron sighed and tugged his beard.</p>

<p class="indent">"You English!" said he. "Your Government
won&#39;t help you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Damn my Government."</p>

<p class="indent">"You English!" said the Baron again, his tone
struggling between admiration and a sort of oppression,
while his face wore the look a man has who sees
another push in front of him in a crowd, and wonders
how the fellow works his way through.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long pause. Ruston lit his pipe, and,
crossing his arms on his breast, blinked at the sun;
the Baron puffed away, shooting a glance now and
then at his young friend, then he asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, my boy, what do you offer?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Shares," answered Ruston composedly.</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron laughed. The impudence of the offer
pleased him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, shares, of course. And besides?"</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston turned to him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shan&#39;t haggle," he announced. "I&#39;ll make you
one offer, Baron, and it&#39;s an uncommon handsome
offer for a trunk of waste paper."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"What&#39;s the offer?" asked the Baron, smiling
with rich subdued mirth.</p>

<p class="indent">"Fifty thousand down, and the same in shares
fully paid."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not enough, my son."</p>

<p class="indent">"All right," and Mr. Ruston rose. "Much obliged
for your hospitality, Baron," he added, holding out
his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where are you going?" asked the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">"Omofaga&mdash;<i>viâ</i> London."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron caught him by the arm, and whispered
in his ear,</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s not so much in it, first and last."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, isn&#39;t there? Then why don&#39;t you take the
offer?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it your money?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s good money. Come, Baron, you&#39;ve always
liked the safe side," and Willie smiled down upon his
host.</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron positively started. This young man
stood over him and told him calmly, face-to-face, the
secret of his life. It was true. How he had envied
men of real nerve, of faith, of daring! But he had
always liked the safe side. Hence he was very rich&mdash;and
a rather weary old man.</p>

<p class="indent">Two days later, Willie Ruston took a cab from
Lord Semingham&#39;s, and drove to Curzon Street. He
arrived at twelve o&#39;clock in the morning. Harry Dennison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
had gone to a Committee at the House. The
butler had just told him so, when a voice cried from
within,</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it you, Mr. Ruston?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison was standing in the hall. He went
in, and followed her into the library.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" she asked, standing by the table, and
wasting no time in formal greetings.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, it&#39;s all right," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"You got my telegram?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Your telegram, Mrs. Dennison?" said he with a
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean&mdash;the telegram," she corrected herself,
smiling in her turn.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes," said Ruston, and he took a step towards
her. "I&#39;ve seen Lord Semingham," he added.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes? And these horrid Germans are out of the
way?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; and Semingham is letting his shooting
this year."</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed, and glanced at him as she asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"Then it cost a great deal?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Fifty thousand!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, then we can&#39;t take Lord Semingham&#39;s shooting,
or anybody else&#39;s. Poor Harry!"</p>

<p class="indent">"He doesn&#39;t know yet?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Aren&#39;t you almost afraid to tell him, Mr. Ruston?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Aren&#39;t you, Mrs. Dennison?"</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled as he asked, and Mrs. Dennison lifted
her eyes to his, and let them dwell there.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why did you do it?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will the money be lost?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I hope not; but money&#39;s always uncertain."</p>

<p class="indent">"The thing&#39;s not uncertain?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; the thing&#39;s certain now."</p>

<p class="indent">She sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, and
passed her hand over her broad brow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why did you do it?" Ruston repeated; and she
laughed nervously.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hate going back," she said, twisting her hands
in her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">He had asked her the question which she had been
asking herself without response.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat down opposite her, flinging his soft cloth
hat&mdash;for he had not been home since his arrival in
London&mdash;on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a bad hat!" said Mrs. Dennison, touching
it with the end of a forefinger.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s done a journey through Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" she laughed gently. "Dear old hat!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks to you, it&#39;ll do another soon."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison sat up straight in her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"You hope&mdash;&mdash;?" she began.</p>

<p class="indent">"To be on my way in six months," he answered
in solid satisfaction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"And for long?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It must take time."</p>

<p class="indent">"What must?"</p>

<p class="indent">"My work there."</p>

<p class="indent">She rose and walked to the window, as she had
when she was about to send the telegram. Now also
she was breathing quickly, and the flush, once so rare
on her cheeks, was there again.</p>

<p class="indent">"And we," she said in a low voice, looking out of
the window, "shall just hear of you once a year?"</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall have regular mails in no time," said he.
"Once a year, indeed! Once a month, Mrs. Dennison!"</p>

<p class="indent">With a curious laugh, she dashed the blind-tassel
against the window. It was not for the sake of hearing
of her that he wanted the mails. With a sudden
impulse she crossed the room and stood opposite him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you care <i>that</i>," she asked, snapping her
fingers, "for any soul alive? You&#39;re delighted to
leave us all and go to Omofaga!"</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston seemed not to hear; he was mentally
organizing the mail service from Omofaga.</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg pardon?" he said, after a perceptible
pause.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" cried Maggie Dennison, and at last her
tone caught his attention.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up with a wrinkle of surprise on his
brow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Why," said he, "I believe you&#39;re angry about
something. You look just as you did on&mdash;on the
memorable occasion."</p>

<p class="indent">"Uh, we aren&#39;t all Carlins!" she exclaimed, carried
away by her feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">The least she had expected from him was grateful
thanks; a homage tinged with admiration was, in
truth, no more than her due; if she had been an ugly
dull woman, yet she had done him a great service, and
she was not an ugly dull woman. But then neither
was she Omofaga.</p>

<p class="indent">"If everybody was as good a fellow as old Carlin&mdash;&mdash;" began
Willie Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"If everybody was as useful and docile, you mean;
as good a tool for you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">At last it was too plain to be missed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "What are you pitching
into me for, Mrs. Dennison?"</p>

<p class="indent">His words were ordinary enough, but at last he
was looking at her, and the mails of Omofaga were for
a moment forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish I&#39;d never made them send the wretched
telegram," she flashed out passionately. "Much
thanks I get!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You shall have a statue in the chief street of the
chief town of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"How dare you! I&#39;m not a girl to be chaffed."</p>

<p class="indent">The tears were standing in her eyes, as she threw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
herself back in a chair. Willie Ruston got up and
stood by her.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll be proud of that telegram some day," he
said, rather as though he felt bound to pay her a compliment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you think that now?" she said, unconvinced
of his sincerity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Though was it very difficult?" he asked
with a sudden change of tone most depreciatory of
her exploit.</p>

<p class="indent">She glanced at him and smiled joyfully. She
liked the depreciation better than the compliment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a bit," she whispered, "for me."</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed slightly, and shut his lips close again.
He began to understand Mrs. Dennison better.</p>

<p class="indent">"Still, though it was easy for you, it was precious
valuable to me," he observed.</p>

<p class="indent">"And how you hate being obliged to me, don&#39;t
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">He perceived that she understood him a little, but
he smiled again as he asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but what made you do it, you know?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean you did? Mr. Ruston, I should like
to see you at work in Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, a very humdrum business," said he, with a
shrug.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll have soldiers?"</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall call &#39;em police," he corrected, smiling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; but they keep everybody down, and&mdash;and
do as you order?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If not, I shall ask &#39;em why."</p>

<p class="indent">"And the natives?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Civilise &#39;em."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&mdash;you&#39;ll be governor?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, dear, no. Local administrator."</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed in his face; and a grim smile from
him seemed to justify her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m glad I sent the telegram," she half-whispered,
lying back in the chair and looking up
at him. "I shall have had something to do
with all that, shan&#39;t I? Do you want any more
money?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here," said Willie Ruston, "Omofaga&#39;s
mine. I&#39;ll find you another place, if you like, when
I&#39;ve put this job through."</p>

<p class="indent">A luxury of pleasure rippled through her laugh.
She darted out her hand and caught his.</p>

<p class="indent">"No. I like Omofaga too!" she said, and as she
said it, the door suddenly opened, and in walked Tom
Loring&mdash;that is to say&mdash;in Tom Loring was about to
walk; but when he saw what he did see, he stood still
for a moment, and then, without a single word, either
of greeting or apology, he turned his back, walked out
again, and shut the door behind him. His entrance
and exit were so quick and sudden, that Mrs. Dennison
had hardly dropped Willie Ruston&#39;s hand before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
he was gone; she had certainly not dropped it before
he came.</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston sat down squarely in a chair. Mrs.
Dennison&#39;s hot mood had been suddenly cooled. She
would not ask him to go, but she glanced at the hat
that had been through Omofaga. He detected her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall stay ten minutes," he observed.</p>

<p class="indent">She understood and nodded assent. Very little
was said during the ten minutes. Mrs. Dennison
seemed tired; her eyes dropped towards the ground,
and she reclined in her chair. Ruston was frowning
and thrumming at intervals on the table. But presently
his brow cleared and he smiled. Mrs. Dennison
saw him from under her drooping lids.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" she asked in a petulant tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe you were going to fight me for Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know what I was doing."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that fellow a fool?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s a much better man than you&#39;ll ever be, Mr.
Ruston. Really you might go now."</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, I will. I&#39;m going down to the city to
see your husband and Carlin."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve wasted your time."</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke with a bitterness which seemed impossible
to miss. But he appeared to miss it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, not a bit, really," he assured her anxiously.
"Good-bye," he added, holding out his hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye. I&#39;ve shaken hands once."</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a moment to see if she would speak
again, but she said nothing. So he left her.</p>

<p class="indent">As he called a hansom, Mrs. Cormack was leaning
over her balcony. She took a little jewelled watch
out of her pocket and looked at it.</p>

<p class="indent">"An hour and a quarter!" she cried. "And I
know the poor man isn&#39;t at home!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE WHEELS.</h3>

<p class="indent">Miss Adela Ferrars lived in Queen&#39;s Gate, in
company with her aunt, Mrs. Topham. Mrs. Topham&#39;s
husband had been the younger son of a peer
of ancient descent; and a practised observer might
almost have detected the fact in her manner, for she
took her station in this life as seriously as her position
in the next, and, in virtue of it, assumed a responsibility
for the morals of her inferiors which betrayed
a considerable confidence in her own. But she was a
good woman, and a widow of the pattern most opposite
to that of Mrs. Cormack. She dwelt more
truly in the grave of her husband than in Queen&#39;s
Gate, and permitted herself no recreations except
such as may privily creep into religious exercises and
the ministrations of favourite clergymen; and it is
pleasant to think that she was very happy. As may
be supposed, however, Adela (who was a good woman
in quite another way, and therefore less congenial
with her aunt than any mere sinner could have been)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
and Mrs. Topham saw very little of one another, and
would not have thought of living together unless each
had been able to supply what the other wanted.
Adela found money for the house, and Mrs. Topham
lent the shelter of her name to her niece&#39;s unprotected
condition. There were separate sitting-rooms
for the two ladies, and, if rumour were true (which,
after all, it usually is not), a separate staircase for the
clergy.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela was in her drawing-room one afternoon
when Lord Semingham was announced. He appeared
to be very warm, and he carried a bundle of papers in
his hand. Among the papers there was one of those
little smooth white volumes which epitomise so much
of the joy and sorrow of this transitory life. He gave
himself a shake, as he sat down, and held up the
book.</p>

<p class="indent">"The car has begun to move," he observed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Juggernaut&#39;s?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; and I have been to see my bankers. I take
a trip to the seaside instead of a moor this year, and
have let my own pheasant shooting."</p>

<p class="indent">He paused and added,</p>

<p class="indent">"Dennison has not taken my shooting. They go
to the seaside too&mdash;with the children."</p>

<p class="indent">He paused again and concluded,</p>

<p class="indent">"The Omofaga prospectus will be out to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela laughed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Bessie is really quite annoyed," remarked Lord
Semingham. "I have seldom seen her so perturbed&mdash;but
I&#39;ve sent Ruston to talk to her."</p>

<p class="indent">"And why did you do it?" asked Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should like to tell you a little history," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">And he told her how Mrs. Dennison had sent a
telegram to Frankfort. This history was long, for
Lord Semingham told it dramatically, as though he
enjoyed its quality. Yet Adela made no comment beyond
asking,</p>

<p class="indent">"And wasn&#39;t she right?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, for the Empire perhaps&mdash;for us, it means
trips to the seaside."</p>

<p class="indent">He drew his chair a little nearer hers, and dropped
his affectation of comic plaintiveness.</p>

<p class="indent">"A most disgusting thing has happened in Curzon
Street," he said. "Have you heard?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; I&#39;ve seen nothing of Maggie lately. You&#39;ve
all been buried in Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush! No words of ill-omen, please! Well, it&#39;s
annoyed me immensely I can&#39;t think what the foolish
fellow means. Tom Loring&#39;s going."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom&mdash;Loring&mdash;going?" she exclaimed with a
punctuated pause between every word. "What in the
world for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What is the ultimate cause of everything that
happens to us now?" he asked, sticking his glass in
his eye.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Adela felt as though she were playing at some absurd
game of questions and answers, and must make
her reply according to the rules.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Mr. Ruston!" she said, with a grimace.</p>

<p class="indent">Her visitor nodded&mdash;as though he had been answered
according to the rules.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom broke out in the most extraordinary manner.
He said he couldn&#39;t stay with Dennison, if Dennison
let Ruston lead him by the nose (<i>ipsissima
verba</i>, my dear Adela), and told Ruston to his face
that he came for no good."</p>

<p class="indent">"Were you there?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. The man seemed to choose the most public
opportunity. Did you ever hear such a thing?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s mad about Mr. Ruston. He talked just
the same way to me. What did Harry Dennison
say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry went up to him and took his hand, and
shook it, and, you know old Harry&#39;s way, tried to
smooth it all down, and get them to shake hands.
Then Ruston got up and said he&#39;d go and leave them
to settle it between Tom and him. Oh, Ruston behaved
very well. It was uncommonly awkward for
him, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; and when he&#39;d gone?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry told Tom that he must keep his engagements;
but that, sooner than lose him, he&#39;d go no
deeper. That was pretty handsome, I thought, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
didn&#39;t suit Tom. &#39;I can&#39;t stay in the house while
that fellow comes,&#39; he said."</p>

<p class="indent">"While he comes to the house?" cried Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham nodded. "You&#39;ve hit the point,"
he seemed to say, and he went on,</p>

<p class="indent">"And then they both turned and looked at Maggie
Dennison. She&#39;d been sitting there without speaking
a single word the whole time. I couldn&#39;t go&mdash;Harry
wouldn&#39;t let me&mdash;so I got into a corner and looked at
the photograph book. I felt rather an ass, between
ourselves, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"And what did Maggie say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry was looking as puzzled as an owl, and Tom
as obstinate as a toad, and both stared at her. She
looked first at Harry, and then at Tom, and smiled in
that quiet way of hers. By the way, I never feel that
I quite understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, never mind! Of course you don&#39;t. Go on."</p>

<p class="indent">"And then she said, &#39;What a fuss! I hope that
after all this Omofaga business is over Mr. Loring
will come back to us.&#39; Pretty straight for Tom,
eh? He turned crimson, and walked right out
of the room, and she sat down at the piano and began
to play some infernal tune, and that soft-hearted
old baby, Harry, blew his nose, and damned the
draught."</p>

<p class="indent">"And he&#39;s going?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"But," she broke out, "how can he? He&#39;s got no
money. What&#39;ll he live on?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry offered him as much as he wanted; but he
said he had some savings, and wouldn&#39;t take a farthing.
He said he&#39;d write for papers, or some such
stuff."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s been with the Dennisons ever since&mdash;oh,
years and years! Can&#39;t you take him? He&#39;d be
awfully useful to you."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear girl, I can&#39;t offer charity to Tom Loring,"
said Semingham, and he added quickly, "No
more can you, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"I quarrelled with him desperately a week ago,"
said she mournfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"About Ruston?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes. About Mr. Ruston, of course."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham whistled gently, and, after a
pause, Adela leant forward and asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you feel quite comfortable about it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hang it, no! But I&#39;m too deep in. I hope to
heaven the public will swallow it!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t mean your wretched Company."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you didn&#39;t?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; I meant Curzon Street."</p>

<p class="indent">"It hardly lies in my mouth to blame Dennison,
or his wife either. If they&#39;ve been foolish, so have I."
Adela looked at him as if she thought him profoundly
unsatisfactory. He was vaguely conscious of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
depreciation, and added, "Ruston&#39;s not a rogue, you
know."</p>

<p class="indent">"No. If I thought he was, I shouldn&#39;t be going
to take shares in Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but I am!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Another spinster lady on my conscience! I shall
certainly end in the dock!" Lord Semingham took
his hat and shook hands. Just as he got to the door,
he turned round, and, with an expression of deprecating
helplessness, fired a last shot. "Ruston came to
see Bessie the other day," he said. "The new mantle
she&#39;s just invented is to be called&mdash;the Omofaga:
That is unless she changes it because of the moor. I
suggested the <i>Pis-aller</i>, but she didn&#39;t see it. She
never does, you know. Good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">The moment he was gone, Adela put on her hat
and drove to Curzon Street. She found Mrs. Dennison
alone, and opened fire at once.</p>

<p class="indent">"What have you done, Maggie?" she cried, flinging
her gloves on the table and facing her friend with
accusing countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison was smelling a rose; she smelt it a
little longer, and then replied with another question.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why can&#39;t men hate quietly? They must make
a fuss. I can go on hating a woman for years and
never show it."</p>

<p class="indent">"We have the vices of servility," said Adela.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Harry is a melancholy sight," resumed Mrs. Dennison.
"He spends his time looking for the blotting-paper;
Tom Loring used to keep it, you
know."</p>

<p class="indent">Her tone deepened the expression of disapproval
on Adela&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve never been so distressed about anything in
my life," said she.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, my dear, he&#39;ll come back." As she spoke, a
sudden mischievous smile spread over her face. "You
should hear Berthe Cormack on it!" she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t want to hear Mrs. Cormack at all. I
hate the woman&mdash;and I think that I&mdash;at any rate&mdash;show
it."</p>

<p class="indent">It surprised Adela to find her friend in such excellent
spirits. The air of listlessness, which was apt
to mar her manner, and even to some degree her appearance
(for to look bored is not becoming), had
entirely vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t seem very sorry about poor Mr. Loring,"
Adela observed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I am; but Mr. Loring can&#39;t stop the wheels
of the world. And it&#39;s his own fault."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela sighed. It did not seem of consequence
whose fault it was.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t think I care much about the wheels of
the world," she said. "How are the children, Maggie?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, splendid, and in great glee about the seaside"&mdash;and
Mrs. Dennison laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"And about losing Tom Loring?"</p>

<p class="indent">"They cried at first."</p>

<p class="indent">"Does anyone ever do anything more than &#39;cry at
first&#39;?" exclaimed Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, my dear, don&#39;t be tragical, or cynical, or
whatever you are being," said Maggie pettishly.
"Mr. Loring has chosen to be very silly, and there&#39;s
an end of it. Have you seen the prospectus? Do
you know Mr. Ruston brought it to show me before it
was submitted to Mr. Belford and the others&mdash;the
Board, I mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think you see quite enough of Mr. Ruston,"
said Adela, putting up her glass and examining
Mrs. Dennison closely. She spoke coolly,
but with a nervous knowledge of her presumption.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison may have had a taste for diplomacy
and the other arts of government, but she
was no diplomatist. She thought herself gravely
wronged by Adela&#39;s suggestion, and burst out angrily,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you&#39;ve been listening to Tom Loring!" and
her heightened colour seemed not to agree with the
idea that, if Adela had listened, Tom had talked
of nothing but Omofaga. "I don&#39;t mind it from
Berthe," Mrs. Dennison continued, "but from you it&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
too bad. I suppose he told you the whole thing? I
declare I wasn&#39;t dreaming of anything of the kind;
I was just excited, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I haven&#39;t seen Mr. Loring," put in Adela as soon
as she could.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then how do you know&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lord Semingham told me you quarrelled with
Mr. Loring about Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that all?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Maggie, was there any more?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you want to quarrel with me too?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe Mr. Loring had good reasons."</p>

<p class="indent">"You must believe what you like," said Mrs. Dennison,
tearing her rose to pieces. "Yes, there was
some more."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" asked Adela, expecting to be told to
mind her own business.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison flung away the rose and began to
laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"He found me holding Willie Ruston&#39;s hand and
telling him I&mdash;liked Omofaga! That&#39;s all."</p>

<p class="indent">"Holding his hand!" exclaimed Adela, justifiably
scandalised and hopelessly puzzled. "What did you
do that for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know," said Mrs. Dennison. "It happened
somehow as we were talking. We got interested,
you know."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela&#39;s next question was also one at which it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
possible to take offence; but she was careless now
whether offence were taken or not.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you and the children going to the seaside
soon?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes," rejoined her friend, still smiling. "We
shall soon be deep in pails and spades and bathing,
and buckets and paddling, and a final charming walk
with Harry in the moonlight."</p>

<p class="indent">As the sentence went on, the smile became more
fixed and less pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">"You ought to be ashamed to talk like that," said
Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison walked up the room and down
again.</p>

<p class="indent">"So I am," she said, pausing to look down on
Adela, and then resuming her walk.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish to goodness this Omofaga affair&mdash;yes, and
Mr. Ruston too&mdash;had never been invented. It seems
to set us all wrong."</p>

<p class="indent">"Wrong!" cried Mrs. Dennison. "Oh, yes, if
it&#39;s wrong to have something one can take a little
interest in!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re hopeless to-day, Maggie. I shall go away.
What did you take his hand for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing. I tell you I was excited."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I think he&#39;s a man one ought to keep cool
with."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, he&#39;s cool enough. He&#39;ll keep you cool."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"But he didn&#39;t&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, don&#39;t&mdash;pray don&#39;t!" cried Mrs. Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela took her leave; and, as luck would have it,
opened the door just as Tom Loring was walking
downstairs with an enormous load of dusty papers in
his hands. She pulled the door close behind her
hastily, exclaiming,</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, I thought you&#39;d gone!"</p>

<p class="indent">"So you&#39;ve heard? I&#39;m just putting things shipshape.
I go this evening."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;m sorry&mdash;still, for your sake, I&#39;m glad."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You may do something on your own account
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t want to do anything," said Tom obstinately.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come and see me some day. I&#39;ve forgiven you,
you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"So I will."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Loring, are you going to say good-bye to
Maggie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. I suppose so." Then he added,
detecting Adela&#39;s unexpressed hope, "Oh, it&#39;s not a
bit of use, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela passed on, and, later, Loring, having
finished his work and being about to go, sought out
Mrs. Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re determined to go, are you?" she asked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
with the air of one who surrenders before an inexplicable
whim.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Tom. "You know I must go."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not a saint&mdash;nor a rogue; if I were either,
I might stay."</p>

<p class="indent">"Or even if you were a sensible man," suggested
Maggie Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"Being merely an honest man, I think I&#39;ll go.
I&#39;ve tried to put all Harry&#39;s things right for him, and
to make it as easy for him to get along as I can."</p>

<p class="indent">"Can he find his papers and blue-books and
things?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes; and I got abstracts ready on all the
things he cares about."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;ll miss you horribly. Ah, well!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose a little; but, really, I think he&#39;ll learn
to get along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison interrupted with a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know," she asked, "what we remind me
of? Why, of a husband and wife separating, and
wondering whether the children will miss poor papa&mdash;though
poor papa insists in going, and mamma is sure
he must."</p>

<p class="indent">"I never mentioned the children," said Tom
angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know you didn&#39;t."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom looked at her for an instant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"For God&#39;s sake," said he, "don&#39;t let him see
that!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, how you twist things!" she cried in impatient
protest.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom only shook his head. The charge was not
sincere.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye, Tom," she went on after a pause. "I
believe, some day or other, you&#39;ll come back&mdash;or, at
any rate, come and live next door&mdash;instead of Berthe
Cormack, you know. But I don&#39;t know in what
state you&#39;ll find us."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;d just like to tell you one thing, if I may," said
Tom, resolutely refusing to meet the softened look in
her eyes with any answering friendliness.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ve got one of the best fellows in the world
for a husband."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I know that, I suppose, at least, as well as
you do."</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s all. Good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">Without more he left her. She drew the window-curtain
aside and watched him get into his cab and
be driven away. The house was very still. Her
husband was in his place at Westminster, and the
children had gone to a party. She went upstairs to
the nursery, hoping to find something to criticise;
then to Harry&#39;s dressing-room, where she filled his
pin-cushion with pins and put fresh water to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
flowers in the vase. She could find no other offices of
wife or mother to do, and she presently found herself
looking into Tom&#39;s room, which was very bare and
desolate, stripped of the homelike growth of a five
years&#39; tenancy. Her excitement was over; she felt
terribly like a child after a tantrum; she flung open
the window of the room and stood listening to the
noise of the town. It was the noise of happy people,
who had plenty to do; or of happier still, who did
not want to do anything, and thus found content.
She turned away and walked downstairs with a step
as heavy as physical weariness brings with it. It
came as a curious aggravation&mdash;light itself, but gaining
weight from its surroundings&mdash;that, for once in a
way, she had no engagements that evening. All the
tide seemed to be flowing by, leaving her behind high
and dry on the shore. Even the children had their
party, even Harry his toy at Westminster; and Willie
Ruston was working might and main to give a good
start to Omofaga. Only of her had the world no
need&mdash;and no heed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>CONVERTS AND HERETICS.</h3>

<p class="indent">Had Lord Semingham and Harry Dennison taken
an opportunity which many persons would have
thought that they had a right to take, they might
have shifted the burden of the Baron&#39;s <i>douceur</i> and
of sundry other not trifling expenses on to the shoulders
of the public, and enjoyed their moors that year
after all; for at the beginning Omofaga obtained such
a moderate and reasonable "boom" as would have enabled
them to perform the operation known as "unloading"
(and literary men must often admire the
terse and condensed expressiveness of "City" metaphors)
with much profit to themselves. But either
they conceived this course of conduct to be beneath
them, or they were so firm of faith in Mr. Ruston
that they stood to their guns and their shares, and
took their seats at the Board, over which Mr. Foster
Belford magniloquently presided, still possessed of the
strongest personal interest in the success of Omofaga.
Lady Semingham, having been made aware
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
that Omofaga shares were selling at forty shillings a
piece, was quite unable to understand why Alfred and
Mr. Dennison did not sell all they had, and thereby
procure moors or whatever else they wanted. Willie
Ruston had to be sent for again, and when he told
her that the same shares would shortly be worth five
pounds (which he did with the most perfect confidence),
she was equally at a loss to see why they were
on sale to anybody who chose to pay forty shillings.
Ruston, who liked to make everybody a convert to his
own point of view, spent the best part of an afternoon
conversing with the little lady, but, when he came
away, he left her placidly admiring the Omofaga mantle
which had just arrived from the milliner&#39;s, and
promised to create an immense sensation.</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe she&#39;s all gown," said he despairingly, at
the Valentines in the evening. "If you undressed
her there&#39;d be no one there."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, there oughtn&#39;t to be many people," said
young Sir Walter, with a hearty laugh at his boyish
joke.</p>

<p class="indent">"Walter, how can you!" cried Marjory.</p>

<p class="indent">This little conversation, trivial though it be, has
its importance, as indicating the very remarkable
change which had occurred in young Sir Walter.
There at least Ruston had made a notable convert,
and he had effected this result by the simple but
audacious device of offering to take Sir Walter with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
him to Omofaga. Sir Walter was dazzled. Between
spending another year or two at Oxford <i>in statu pupillari</i>,
vexed by schools and disciplined by proctors&mdash;between
being required to be in by twelve at night
and unable to visit London without permission&mdash;between
this unfledged state and the position of a man
among the men who were in the vanguard of the empire
there rolled a flood; and the flood was mighty
enough to sweep away all young Sir Walter&#39;s doubts
about Mr. Ruston being a gentleman, to obliterate
Evan Haselden&#39;s sneers, to uproot his influence&mdash;in a
word, to transform that youthful legislator from a
paragon of wisdom and accomplishments into "a good
chap, but rather a lot of side on, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory, having learnt from literature that hers
was supposed to be the fickle sex, might well open her
eyes and begin to feel very sorry indeed for poor Evan
Haselden. But she also was under the spell and
hailed the sun of glory rising for her brother out of
the mists of Omofaga; and if poor Lady Valentine
shed some tears before Willie Ruston convinced her
of the rare chance it was for her only boy&mdash;and a few
more after he had so convinced her&mdash;why, it would be
lucky if these were the only tears lost in the process
of developing Omofaga; for it seems that great enterprises
must always be watered by the tears of mothers
and nourished on the blood of sons. <i>Sic fortis Etruria
crevit.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span></p>

<p class="indent">One or two other facts may here be chronicled
about Omofaga. There were three great meetings:
one at the Cannon Street Hotel, purely commercial;
another at the Westminster Town Hall, commercial-political;
a third at Exeter Hall, commercial-religious.
They were all very successful, and, taken together,
were considered to cover the ground pretty
completely. The most unlike persons and the most
disparate views found a point of union in Omofaga.
Adela Ferrars put three thousand pounds into it,
Lady Valentine a thousand. Mr. Carlin finally disposed
of the coal business, and his wife dreamt of the
workhouse all night and scolded herself for her lack
of faith all the morning. Willie Ruston spoke of being
off in five months, and Sir Walter immediately
bought a complete up-country outfit.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly there was a cloud. Omofaga began to
be "written down," in the most determined and able
manner. The anonymous detractor&mdash;in such terms
did Mr. Foster Belford refer to the writer&mdash;used the
columns of a business paper of high standing, and his
letters, while preserving a judicial and temperate
tone, were uncompromisingly hostile and exceedingly
damaging. A large part of Omofaga (he said) had
not been explored, indeed, nobody knew exactly what
was and what was not Omofaga; let the shareholders
get what comfort they could out of that; but, so far
as Omofaga had been explored, it had been proved to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
be barren of all sources of wealth. The writer grudgingly
admitted that it might feed a certain head of
cattle, though he hastened to add that the flies were
fatal all the hot months; but as for gold, or diamonds,
or any such things as companies most love,
there were none, and if there were, they could not be
won, and if they could be won no European could live
to win them. It was a timid time on the markets
then, and people took fright easily. In a few days any
temptation that might have assailed Lord Semingham
and Harry Dennison lost its power. Omofagas were
far below par, and Lady Semingham was entreating
her husband to buy all he could against the hour when
they should be worth five pounds a piece, because, as
she said, Mr. Ruston was quite sure that they were
going to be, and who knew more about it than Mr.
Ruston?</p>

<p class="indent">It was just about this time that Tom Loring, who
had vanished completely for a week or two, after his
departure from Curzon Street, came up out of the
depths and called on Adela Ferrars in Queen&#39;s Gate;
and her first remark showed that she was a person of
some perspicacity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Isn&#39;t this rather small of you?" she asked,
putting on her eyeglasses and finding an article
which she indicated. "You may not like him, but
still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"How like a woman!" said Tom Loring in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
tone of a man who expects and, on the whole, welcomes
ill-usage. "How did you know it was mine?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s so like that article of Harry Dennison&#39;s. I
think you might put your name, anyhow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and rob what I say of all weight. Who
knows my name?"</p>

<p class="indent">Adela felt an impulse to ask him angrily why
nobody knew his name, but she inquired instead what
he thought he knew about Omofaga. She put this
question in a rather offensive tone.</p>

<p class="indent">It appeared that Tom Loring knew a great deal
about Omofaga, all, in fact, that there was to be
learnt from blue-books, consular reports, gazetteers,
travels, and other heavy works of a like kind.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ve been moling in the British Museum,"
cried Adela accusingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom admitted it without the least shame.</p>

<p class="indent">"I knew this thing was a fraud and the man a
fraud, and I determined to show him up if I could,"
said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s because you hate him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then it&#39;s lucky for the British investor that I do
hate him."</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s not lucky for me," said Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t mean to say you&#39;ve been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Fool enough? Yes, I have. No, don&#39;t quarrel
again. It won&#39;t ruin me, anyhow. Are the things
you say really true?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Tom replied by another question.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think I&#39;d write &#39;em if I didn&#39;t believe
they were?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, but you might believe they were because you
hate him."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom seemed put out at this idea. It is not one
that generally suggests itself to a man when his own
views are in question.</p>

<p class="indent">"I admit I began because I hate him," he said,
with remarkable candour, after a moment&#39;s consideration;
"but, by Jove, as I went on I found plenty of
justification. Look here, you mustn&#39;t tell anyone I&#39;m
writing them."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom looked a little embarrassed as he made this
request.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela hesitated for a moment. She did not like
the request, either.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I won&#39;t," she said at last; and she added,
"I&#39;m beginning to think I hate him, too. He&#39;s turning
me into an hospital."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"People he wounds come to me. Old Lady Valentine
came and cried because Walter&#39;s going to Omofaga;
and Evan came and&mdash;well, swore because Walter
worships Mr. Ruston; and Harry Dennison came and
looked bewildered, and&mdash;you know&mdash;because&mdash;oh, because
of you, and so on."</p>

<p class="indent">"And now I come, don&#39;t I?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and now you."</p>

<p class="indent">"And has Mrs. Dennison come?" asked Tom,
with a look of disconcerting directness.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," snapped Adela, and she looked at the floor,
whereupon Tom diverted his eyes from her and stared
at the ceiling.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he searched in his waistcoat pocket and
brought out a little note.</p>

<p class="indent">"Read that," he said, a world of disgust in his
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"&#39;I told you so.&mdash;B.C.&#39;" read Adela. "Oh, it&#39;s
that Cormack woman!" she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">"You see what it means? She means I&#39;ve been
got rid of in order that&mdash;&mdash;" Tom stopped, and
brought his clenched fist down on his opened palm.
"If I thought it, I&#39;d shoot the fellow," he ended.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her for the answer to his unexpressed
question.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela turned the pestilential note over and over in
her fingers, handling it daintily as though it might
stain.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t think he means it," she said at last, without
trying to blink the truth of Tom&#39;s interpretation.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom rose and began to walk about.</p>

<p class="indent">"Women beat me," he broke out. "I don&#39;t understand
&#39;em. How should I? I&#39;m not one of these
fellows who catch women&#39;s fancy&mdash;thank God!"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you continue to dislike the idea, you&#39;ll probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
manage to escape the reality," observed Adela,
and her tone, for some reason or other&mdash;perhaps
merely through natural championship of her sex&mdash;was
rather cold and her manner stiff.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, some women are all right;" and Adela acknowledged
the concession with a satirical bow.
"Look here, can&#39;t you help?" he burst out. "Tell
her what a brute he is."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you do not understand women!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, then, I shall tell Dennison. He won&#39;t
stand nonsense of that kind."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll deserve horsewhipping if you do," remarked
Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then what am I to do?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing. In fact, Mr. Loring, you have no genius
for delicate operations."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course I&#39;m a fool."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela played with her <i>pince-nez</i> for a minute or
two, put it on, looked at him, and then said, with just
a touch of unwonted timidity in her voice,</p>

<p class="indent">"Anyhow, you happen to be a gentleman."</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Tom had been a good deal buffeted of late,
and a friendly stroking was a pleasant change. He
looked up with a smile, but as he looked up Adela
looked away.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I&#39;ll stop those articles," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, do," she cried, a bright smile on her face.</p>

<p class="indent">"They&#39;ve pretty well done their work, too."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t! Don&#39;t spoil it! But&mdash;but don&#39;t you get
money for them?"</p>

<p class="indent">Tom was in better humour now. He held out his
hand with his old friendly smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, wait till I am in the workhouse, and then
you shall take me out."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t believe I did mean that," protested
Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"You always mean everything that&mdash;that the best
woman in the world could mean," and Tom wrung her
hand and disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela&#39;s hand was rather crushed and hurt, and for
a moment she stood regarding it ruefully.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought he was going to kiss it," she said.
"One of those fellows who take women&#39;s fancy, perhaps,
would have! And&mdash;and it wouldn&#39;t have hurt
so much. Ah, well, I&#39;m very glad he&#39;s going to stop
the articles."</p>

<p class="indent">And the articles did stop; and perhaps things
might have fallen out worse than that an honest
man, driven hard by bitterness, should do a useful
thing from a doubtful motive, and having done just
enough of it, should repent and sin no more; for unquestionably
the articles prevented a great many persons
from paying an unduly high price for Omofaga
shares. This line of thought seems defensible, but it
was not Adela&#39;s. She rejoiced purely that Tom should
turn away from the doubtful thing; and if Tom had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
been a man of greater acuteness, it would have struck
him as worthy of note, perhaps even of gratification,
that Miss Adela Ferrars should care so much whether
he did or did not do doubtful things. But then Miss
Ferrars&mdash;for it seems useless to keep her secret any
longer, the above recorded interview having somewhat
impaired its mystery&mdash;was an improbably romantic
person&mdash;such are to be met even at an age beyond
twenty-five&mdash;and was very naturally ashamed of her
weakness. People often are ashamed of being better
than their surroundings. Being better they feel better,
and feeling better they feel priggish, and then they try
not to be better, and happily fail. So Adela was very
shamefaced over her ideal, and would as soon have
thought of preaching on a platform&mdash;of which practice
she harboured a most bigoted horror&mdash;as of proclaiming
the part that love must play in her marriage.
The romantic resolve lay snug in its hidden nest, sheltered
from cold gusts of ridicule by a thick screen of
worldly sayings, and, when she sent away a suitor, of
worldly-wise excuses. Thus no one suspected it, not
even Tom Loring, although he thought her "the
best of women;" a form of praise, by the way, that
gave the lady honoured by it less pleasure than less
valuable commendation might have done. Why best?
Why not most charming? Well, probably because he
thought the one and didn&#39;t think the other. She was
the best; but there was another whose doings and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
whose peril had robbed Tom Loring of his peace, and
made him do the doubtful thing. Why had he done
it? Or (and Adela smiled mockingly at this resurrection
of the Old Woman), if he did do it, why did
he do it for Maggie Dennison? She didn&#39;t believe he
would ever do a doubtful thing for her. For that she
loved him; but perhaps she would have loved him&mdash;well,
not less&mdash;if he did; for how she would forgive
him!</p>

<p class="indent">After half-an-hour of this kind of thing&mdash;it was
her own summary of her meditations&mdash;she dressed,
went out to dinner, sat next Evan Haselden, and said
cynical things all the evening; so that, at last Evan
told her that she had no more feeling than a mummified
Methodist. This was exactly what she wanted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>AN OPPRESSIVE ATMOSPHERE.</h3>

<p class="indent">The Right Honourable Foster Belford, although
not, like Mr. Pitt, famous for "ruining Great Britain
gratis"&mdash;perhaps merely from want of the opportunity&mdash;had
yet not made a fortune out of political life,
and it had suggested a pleasant addition to his means,
when Willie Ruston offered him the chairmanship of
the Omofaga Company, with the promise of a very
comfortable yearly honorarium. He accepted the
post with alacrity, but without undue gratitude, for
he considered himself well worth the price; and the
surprising fact is that he was well worth it. He
bulked large to the physical and mental view. His
colleagues in the Cabinet had taken a year or two to
find out his limits, and the public had not found them
out yet. Therefore he was not exactly a fool. On
the other hand, the limits were certainly there, and so
there was no danger of his developing an inconvenient
greatness. As has been previously hinted, he enjoyed
Harry Dennison&#39;s entire confidence; and he could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
relied upon not to understand Lord Semingham&#39;s
irreverence. Thus his appointment did good to the
Omofaga as well as to himself, and only the initiated
winked when Willie Ruston hid himself behind this
imposing figure and pulled the strings.</p>

<p class="indent">"The best of it is," Ruston remarked to Semingham,
"that you and Carlin will have the whole thing
in your own hands when I&#39;ve gone out. Belford
won&#39;t give you any trouble."</p>

<p class="indent">"But, my dear fellow, I don&#39;t want it all in my
hands. I want to grow rich out of it without any
trouble."</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston twisted his cigar in his mouth. The prospect
of immediate wealth flowing in from Omofaga
was, as Lord Semingham knew very well, not
assured.</p>

<p class="indent">"Loring&#39;s stopped hammering us," said Ruston;
"that&#39;s one thing."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you found out he wrote them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; and uncommonly well he did it, confound
him. I wish we could get that fellow. There&#39;s a
good deal in him."</p>

<p class="indent">"You see," observed Lord Semingham, "he
doesn&#39;t like you. I don&#39;t know that you went the
right way about to make him."</p>

<p class="indent">The remark sounded blunt, but Semingham had
learnt not to waste delicate phrases on Willie Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I didn&#39;t know he was worth the trouble."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"One path to greatness is said to be to make no
enemies."</p>

<p class="indent">"A very roundabout one, I should think. I&#39;m
going to make a good many enemies in Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham suddenly rose, put on his hat,
and left the offices of the Company. Mrs. Dennison
had, a little while ago, complained to him that she
ate, drank, breathed and wore Omofaga. He had
detected the insincerity of her complaint, but he was
becoming inclined to echo it in all genuineness on his
own account. There were moments when he wondered
how and why he had allowed this young man to
lead him so far and so deep; moments when a convulsion
of Nature, redistributing Africa and blotting
out Omofaga, would have left him some thousands of
pounds poorer in purse, but appreciably more cheerful
in spirit. Perhaps matters would mend when the
Local Administrator had departed to his local administration,
and only the mild shadow of him which
bore the name of Carlin trod the boards of Queen
Street, Cheapside. Ruston began to be oppressive.
The restless energy and domineering mind of the man
wearied Semingham&#39;s indolent and dilettante spirit,
and he hailed the end of the season as an excellent
excuse for putting himself beyond the reach of his
colleague for a few weeks. Yet, the more he quailed,
the more he trusted; and when a very great man,
holding a very great office, met him in the House of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Lords, and expressed the opinion that when the Company
and Mr. Ruston went to Omofaga they would
find themselves in a pretty hornets&#39; nest, Lord Semingham
only said that he should be sorry for the
hornets.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t ask us to fetch your man out for you,
that&#39;s all," said the very great man.</p>

<p class="indent">And for an instant Lord Semingham, still feeling
that load upon his shoulders, fancied that it would be
far from his heart to prefer such a request. There
might be things less just and fitting than that Willie
Ruston and those savage tribes of Omofaga should be
left to fight out the quarrel by themselves, the civilised
world standing aloof. And the dividends&mdash;well,
of course, there were the dividends, but Lord Semingham
had in his haste forgotten them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, you don&#39;t know Ruston," said he, shaking a
forefinger at the great man.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t I? He came every day to my office for a
fortnight."</p>

<p class="indent">"Wanted something?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, he wanted something certainly, or he
wouldn&#39;t have come, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Got it, I suppose?" asked Lord Semingham, in
a tone curiously indicative of resignation rather than
triumph.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, yes; I did, at last, not without hesitation,
accede to his request."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Then Lord Semingham, with no apparent excuse,
laughed in the face of the great man, left the House
(much in the same sudden way as he had left Queen
Street, Cheapside), and passed rapidly through the
lobbies till he reached Westminster Hall. Here he
met a young man, clad to perfection, but looking sad.
It was Evan Haselden. With a sigh of relief at meeting
no one of heavier metal, Semingham stopped him
and began to talk. Evan&#39;s melancholy air enveloped
his answers in a mist of gloom. Moreover there was
a large streak on his hat, where the nap had been
rubbed the wrong way; evidently he was in trouble.
Presently he seized his friend by the arm, and proposed
a walk in the Park.</p>

<p class="indent">"But are you paired?" asked Semingham; for an
important division was to occur that day in the Commons.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," said Evan fiercely. "Come along;" and
Lord Semingham went, exclaiming inwardly, "A
girl!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m the most miserable devil alive," said Evan,
as they left the Horse Guards on the right hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Semingham put up his eyeglass.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve always regarded you as the favourite of fortune,"
he said. "What&#39;s the matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">The matter unfolded itself some half-hour after
they had reached the Row and sat down. It came
forth with difficulty; pride obstructed the passage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
and something better than pride made the young man
diffuse in the telling of his trouble. Lord Semingham
grew very grave indeed. Let who would laugh
at happy lovers, he had a groan for the unfortunate&mdash;a
groan with reservations.</p>

<p class="indent">"She said she liked me very much, but didn&#39;t feel&mdash;didn&#39;t,
you know, look up to me enough, and so on,"
said poor Evan in puzzled pain. "I&mdash;I can&#39;t think
what&#39;s come over her. She used to be quite different.
I don&#39;t know what she means by talking like that."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham played a tune on his knee with
the fingers of one hand. He was waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">"Young Val&#39;s gone back on me too," moaned
Evan, who took the brother&#39;s deposal of him hardly
more easily than the sister&#39;s rejection. Suddenly he
brightened up; a smile, but a bitter one, gleamed
across his face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I&#39;ve put one spoke in his wheel, though,"
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ruston&#39;s?" inquired Semingham, still playing
his tune.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. A fortnight ago, old Detchmore" (Lord
Detchmore was the very great man before referred to)
"asked me if I knew Loring. You know Ruston&#39;s
been trying to get Detchmore to back him up in making
a railway to Omofaga?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t know," said Lord Semingham, with an
unmoved face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re a director, aren&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Go on, my dear boy."</p>

<p class="indent">"And Detchmore had seen Loring&#39;s articles. Well,
I took Tom to him, and we left him quite decided to
have nothing to do with it. Oh, by Jove, though, I
forgot; I suppose you&#39;d be on the other side there,
wouldn&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose I should, but it doesn&#39;t matter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I fancy Ruston&#39;s got what he wanted;"
and Lord Semingham related what he had heard from
the Earl of Detchmore.</p>

<p class="indent">Evan listened in silence, and, the tale ended, the
two lay back in their chairs, and idly looked at the
passing carriages. At last Lord Semingham spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s going to Omofaga in a few months," he observed.
"And, Evan, you don&#39;t mean that he&#39;s your
rival at the Valentines&#39;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not so sure, confound him. You know how
pretty she is."</p>

<p class="indent">Semingham knew that she was pretty; but he also
knew that she was poor, and thought that she was, if
not too insipid (for he recognised the unusual taste of
his own mind), at least too immature to carry Willie
Ruston off his feet, and into a love affair that promised
no worldly gain.</p>

<p class="indent">"I asked Mrs. Dennison what she thought," pursued
Evan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you did?"</p>

<p class="indent">"But the idea seemed quite a new one to her.
That&#39;s good, you know. I expect she&#39;d have noticed
if he&#39;d shown any signs."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham thought it very likely.</p>

<p class="indent">"Anyhow," Evan continued, "Marjory&#39;s awfully
keen about him."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;ll be in Omofaga in three or four months,"
Semingham repeated. It was all the consolation he
could offer.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Evan got up and strode away. Lord
Semingham sat on, musing on the strange turmoil the
coming of the man had made in the little corner of
the world he dwelt in. He was reminded of what was
said concerning Lord Byron by another poet. They
all felt Ruston. His intrusion into the circle had
changed all the currents, so that sympathy ran no
longer between old friends, and hearts answered to a
new stimulus. Some he attracted, some he repelled;
none did he leave alone. From great to small his influence
ran; from the expulsion of Tom Loring to the
christening of the Omofaga mantle. Semingham had
an acute sense of the absurdity of it all, but he had
seen absurd things happen too often to be much relieved
by his intuition. And when absurd things
happen, they have consequences just as other things
have. And the most exasperating fact was the utter
unconsciousness of the disturber. He had no mystery-airs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
no graces, no seeming fascinations. He was
relentlessly business-like, unsentimental, downright;
he took it all as a matter of course. He did not pry
for weak spots. He went right on&mdash;on and over&mdash;and
seemed not to know when he was going over. A
very Juggernaut indeed! Semingham thanked Adela
for teaching him the word.</p>

<p class="indent">He was suddenly roused by the merry laughter of
children. Three or four little ones were scampering
along the path in the height of glee. As they came
up, he recognised them. He had seen them once before.
They were Carlin&#39;s children. Five there were,
he counted now; three ran ahead; two little girls
held each a hand of Willie Ruston&#39;s, who was laughing
as merrily as his companions. The whole group
knew Semingham, and the eldest child was by his
knees in a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;ve been to the Exhibition," she cried exultantly;
"and now Willie&mdash;Mr. Ruston, I mean&mdash;is
taking us to have ices in Bond Street."</p>

<p class="indent">"A human devil!" said the astonished man to
himself, as Willie Ruston plumped down beside him,
imploring a brief halt, and earnestly asseverating that
his request was in good faith, and concealed no lurking
desire to evade the ices.</p>

<p class="indent">"I met young Haselden as we came along," Ruston
observed, wiping his brow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! Yes, he&#39;s been with me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The children had wandered a few yards off, and
stood impatiently looking at their hero.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s had a bit of a facer, I fancy," pursued
Willie Ruston. "Heard about it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Something."</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;ll come all right, I should think," said Ruston,
in a comfortably careless tone. "He&#39;s not a bad
fellow, you know, though he&#39;s not over-appreciative of
me." Lord Semingham found no comment. "I
hear you&#39;re going to Dieppe next week?" asked Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. My wife and Mrs. Dennison have put
their heads together, and fixed on that. You know
we&#39;re economising."</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose you are," he said through his white
teeth. The idea seemed to amuse him. "We may
meet there. I&#39;ve promised to run over for a few days
if I can."</p>

<p class="indent">"The deuce you have!" would have expressed his
companion&#39;s feelings; but Lord Semingham only
said, "Oh, really?"</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, I&#39;m coming directly," Ruston cried a
moment later to his young friends, and, with a
friendly nod, he rose and went on his way. Lord
Semingham watched the party till it disappeared
through the Park gates, hearing in turn the children&#39;s
shrill laugh and Willie Ruston&#39;s deeper notes. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
effect of the chance meeting was to make his fancies
and his fancied feelings look still more absurd. That
he perceived at once; the devil appeared so very human
in such a mood and such surroundings. Yet
that attribute&mdash;that most demoniac attribute&mdash;of
ubiquity loomed larger and larger. For not even a
foreign land&mdash;not even a watering-place of pronounced
frivolity&mdash;was to be a refuge. The man was coming
to Dieppe! And on whose bidding? Semingham
had no doubt on whose bidding; and, out of the airy
forms of those absurd fancies, there seemed to rise a
more material shape, a reality, a fabric not compounded
wholly of dreams, but mixed of stuff that
had made human comedies and human tragedies since
the world began. Mrs. Dennison had bidden Willie
Ruston to Dieppe. That was Semingham&#39;s instant
conclusion; she had bidden him, not merely by a formal
invitation, or by a simple acquiescence, but by
the will and determination which possessed her to be
of his mind and in his schemes. And perhaps Evan
Haselden&#39;s innocent asking of her views had carried its
weight also. For nearly an hour Semingham sat and
mused. For awhile he thought he would act; but how
should he act? And why? And to what end? Since
what must be must, and in vain do we meddle with fate.
An easy, almost eager, recognition of the inevitable
in the threatened, of the necessary in everything that
demanded effort for its avoidance, had stamped his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
life and grown deep into his mind. Wherefore now,
faced with possibilities that set his nerves on edge,
and wrung his heart for good friends, he found nothing
better to do than shrug his shoulders and thank
God that his own wife&#39;s submission to the man went
no deeper than the inside lining of that famous Omofaga
mantle, nor his own than the bottom, or near the
bottom, of his trousers&#39; pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">"Though that, in faith," he exclaimed ruefully,
as at last he rose, "is, in this world of ours, pretty
deep!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>A LADY&#39;S BIT OF WORK.</h3>

<p class="indent">The Dennison children, after a two nights&#39; banishment,
had come down to dessert again. They had
been in sore disgrace, caused (it was stated to Mrs.
Cormack, who had been invited to dine <i>en famille</i>) by
a grave breach of hospitality and good manners which
Madge had led the younger ones&mdash;who tried to look
plaintively innocent&mdash;into committing.</p>

<p class="indent">The Carlin children had come to tea, and a great
dissension had arisen between the two parties. The
Carlins had belauded the generous donor of ices;
Madge had taken up the cudgels fiercely on Tom
Loring&#39;s behalf, and Dora and Alfred had backed her
up. Each side proceeded from praise of its own favourite
to sneers&mdash;by no means covert&mdash;at the other&#39;s
man, and the feud had passed from the stage of words
to that of deeds before it was discovered by the superior
powers and crushed. On the hosts, of course,
the blame had to fall; they were sent to bed, while
the guests drove off in triumph, comforted by sweets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
and shillings. Madge did not think, or pretend to
think, that this was justice, and her mother&#39;s recital
of her crimes to Mrs. Cormack, so far from reducing
her to penitence, brought back to her cheeks and eyes
the glow they had worn when she slapped (there is no
use in blinking facts) Jessie Carlin, and told her that
she hated Mr. Ruston. Madge Dennison was like her
mother in face and temper. That may have been the
reason why Harry Dennison squeezed her hand under
the table, and by his tacit aid broke the force of his
wife&#39;s cold reproofs. But there was perhaps another
reason also.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack said that she was shocked, and
looked very much amused. The little history made
up for the bore of having the children brought in.
That was a thing she objected to very much; it
stopped all rational conversation. But now her curiosity
was stirred.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why don&#39;t you like Mr. Ruston, my child?" she
asked Madge.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t dislike him," said Madge, rosy red, and
speaking with elaborate slowness. She said it as
though it were a lesson she had learnt.</p>

<p class="indent">"But why, then," said Mrs. Cormack, whirling her
hands, "beat the little Carlin?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That was before mamma told me," answered
Madge, the two younger ones sitting by, open-mouthed,
to hear her explanation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, what an obedient child! How I should have
liked a little girl like you, darling!"</p>

<p class="indent">Madge hated sarcasm, and her feelings towards
Mrs. Cormack reflected those of her idol, Tom Loring.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know what you mean," she said curtly;
and then she looked anxiously at her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">But Mrs. Dennison was smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let her alone, Berthe," she said. "She&#39;s been
punished. Give her some fruit, Harry."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison piled up the plate eagerly held
out to him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who&#39;ll give you fruit at Dieppe?" he asked,
stroking his daughter&#39;s hair.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack pricked up her ears.</p>

<p class="indent">"Didn&#39;t we tell you?" asked Mrs. Dennison.
"Harry can&#39;t come for a fortnight. That tiresome
old Sir George" (Sir George was the senior partner in
Dennison, Sons &amp; Company) "is down with the gout,
and Harry&#39;s got to stay in town. But I&#39;ll give Madge
fruit&mdash;if she&#39;s good."</p>

<p class="indent">"Papa gives it me anyhow," said Madge, who preferred
unconditional benefits.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry laughed dolefully. He had been looking
forward to a holiday with his children. Their uninterrupted
society would have easily consoled him for
the loss of the moor.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s an awful bore," he said; "but there&#39;s no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
help for it. Sir George can&#39;t put a foot to the
ground."</p>

<p class="indent">"Anyhow," suggested Mrs. Cormack, "you will be
able to help Mr. Ruston with the Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"Papa," broke out Madge, her face bright with a
really happy idea, which must, she thought, meet with
general acceptance, "since you can&#39;t come, why
shouldn&#39;t Tom?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack grew more amused. Oh, it was
quite worth while to have the children! They were
so good at saying things one couldn&#39;t say oneself; and
then one could watch the effect. In an impulse of
gratitude, she slid a banana on to Madge&#39;s plate.</p>

<p class="indent">"Marjory Valentine&#39;s coming," said Mrs. Dennison.
"You like her, don&#39;t you, Madge?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s a girl," said Madge scornfully; and Harry,
with a laugh, stroked her hair again.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re a little flirt," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"But why can&#39;t Tom?" persisted Madge, as she
attacked the banana. It was Mrs. Cormack&#39;s gift, but&mdash;<i>non
olet</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment nobody answered. Then Harry
Dennison said&mdash;not in the least as though he believed
it, or expected anybody else to believe it&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom&#39;s got to stay and work."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have all the gentlemen we know got to stay and
work?"</p>

<p class="indent">Harry nodded assent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack was leaning forward. A moment later
she sank back, hiding a smile behind her napkin;
for Madge observed, in a tone of utter contentment,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, then, Mr Ruston won&#39;t come;" and she
wagged her head reassuringly at the open-mouthed
little ones. They were satisfied, and fell again to eating.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few moments, Mrs. Dennison, who had
made no comment on her daughter&#39;s inference, swept
the flock off to bed, praying Berthe to excuse her temporary
absence. It was her habit to go upstairs with
them when possible, and Harry would see that coffee
came.</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor Madge!" said Harry, when the door was
shut, "what&#39;ll she say when Ruston turns up?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Then he does go?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think so. We&#39;d asked him to stay with us, and
though he can&#39;t do that now, he and young Walter
Valentine talk of running over for a few days. I
hope they will."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack, playing with her teaspoon, glanced
at her host out of the corner of her eye.</p>

<p class="indent">"He can go all the better, as I shall be here,"
continued Harry. "I can look after Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack rapped the teaspoon sharply on her
cup. The man was such a fool. Harry, dimly recognising
her irritation, looked up inquiringly; but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
hesitated before she spoke. Would it spoil sport or
make sport if she stirred a suspicion in him? A
thought threw its weight in the balance. Maggie
Dennison&#39;s friendship had been a trifle condescending,
and the grateful friend pictured her under the indignity
of enforced explanations, of protests, even of
orders to alter her conduct. But how would Harry
take a hint? There were men silly enough to resent
such hints. Caution was the word.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I almost wish he wasn&#39;t going," she said at
last. "For Maggie&#39;s sake, I mean. She wants a
complete rest."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but she likes him. He amuses her. Why,
she&#39;s tremendously interested in Omofaga, Mrs. Cormack."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, but he excites her too. We poor women
have nerves, Mr. Dennison. It would be much better
for her to hear nothing of Omofaga for a few
weeks."</p>

<p class="indent">"Has she been talking to you much about it?"
asked Harry, beginning to feel anxious at his guest&#39;s
immensely solemn tone.</p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, little Mrs. Cormack spoke for the nonce
quite like a family physician.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes, about it and him," she replied. "She&#39;s
never off the subject. Mr. Loring was half right."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom&#39;s objections were based on quite other
grounds."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, were they really? I thought&mdash;well, anyhow,
Mr. Ruston being there will do her no good. She&#39;ll
like it immensely, of course."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison rubbed his hand over his chin.</p>

<p class="indent">"I see what you mean," he said. "Yes, she&#39;d
have been better away from everything. But I can&#39;t
object to Ruston going. I asked him myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, when you were going."</p>

<p class="indent">"That makes no difference."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack said nothing. She tapped her
spoon against the cup once more.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, we should have talked all the more about
it if I&#39;d been there."</p>

<p class="indent">His companion was still silent, her eyes turned
down towards the table. Harry looked at her with
perplexity, and when he next spoke, there was a curious
appealing note in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Surely it doesn&#39;t make any difference?" he
asked. "What difference can it make?"</p>

<p class="indent">No answer came. Mrs. Cormack laid down the
spoon and sat back in her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean there&#39;ll be no one to make a change
for her&mdash;to distract her thoughts?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack flung her hands out with an air of
impatience.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I meant nothing," said she petulantly.</p>

<p class="indent">The clock seemed to tick very loud in the silence
that followed her words.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I wish I could go," said Harry at last, in a low
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I wish you could, Mr. Dennison;" and as
she spoke she raised her eyes, and, for the first time,
looked full in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry rose from his chair; at the same moment
his wife re-entered the room. He started a little at
the sight of her.</p>

<p class="indent">She held a letter in her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Ruston will be at Dieppe on the 15th with
Walter Valentine," she said, referring to it. "Give
me some coffee, Harry."</p>

<p class="indent">He poured it out and gave it to her, saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"A letter from Ruston? Let&#39;s see what he says."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, there&#39;s nothing else," she answered, laying it
beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack sat looking on.</p>

<p class="indent">"May I see?" asked Harry Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you like," she answered, a little surprised;
and, turning to Mrs. Cormack, she added, "Mr. Ruston&#39;s
a man of few words on paper."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, he makes every word mean something, I
expect," returned that lady, who was quite capable of
the same achievement herself, and exhibited it in this
very speech.</p>

<p class="indent">"What does he mean by the postscript?&mdash;&#39;Have
you found another kingdom yet?&#39;" asked Harry,
with a puzzled frown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s a joke, dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"But what does it mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, my dear Harry, I can&#39;t explain jokes."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry laid the note down again.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s a joke between ourselves," Mrs. Dennison
went on. "I oughtn&#39;t to have shown you the letter.
Come, Berthe, we&#39;ll go upstairs."</p>

<p class="indent">And Mrs. Cormack had no alternative but to obey.</p>

<p class="indent">Left alone, Harry Dennison drew his chair up to
the hearthrug. There was no fire, but he acted as
though there were, leaning forward with his elbows
on his knees, and gazing into the grate. He felt hurt
and disconsolate. His old grievance&mdash;that people left
him out&mdash;was strong upon him. He had delighted in
the Omofaga scheme, because he had been in the inside
ring there&mdash;because he was of importance to it&mdash;because
it showed him to his wife as a mover in great
affairs. And now&mdash;somehow&mdash;he seemed to be being
pushed outside there too. What was this joke between
themselves? At Dieppe they would have all
that out; he would not be in the way there. Then
he did not understand what Berthe Cormack would
be at. She had looked at him so curiously. He did
not know what to make of it, and he wished that
Tom Loring were on the other side of the fireplace.
Then he could ask him all about it. Tom! Why,
Tom had looked at him almost in the same way as
Berthe Cormack had&mdash;just when he was wringing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
hand in farewell. No, it was not the same way&mdash;and
yet in part the same. Tom&#39;s look had pity in it, and
no derision. Mrs. Cormack&#39;s derision was but touched
with pity. Yet both seemed to ask, "Don&#39;t you
see?" See what? Why had Tom gone away? He
could rely on Tom. See what? There was nothing
to see.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat longer than he meant. It was past ten
when he went upstairs. Mrs. Cormack had gone, and
his wife was in an armchair by the open window.
He came in softly and surprised her with her head
thrown back on the cushions and a smile on her lips.
And the letter was in her hands. Hearing his step
when he was close by her, she sat up, letting the note
fall to the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a time you&#39;ve been! Berthe&#39;s gone.
Were you asleep?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. I was thinking; Maggie, I wish I could
come to Dieppe with you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, I wish you could," said she graciously.
"But you&#39;re left in charge of Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke as though in that charge lay consolation
more than enough.</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe you care&mdash;I mean you think more about
Omofaga than about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Anything in the world?" she asked, in playful
mockery.</p>

<p class="indent">"Than about me," he went on stubbornly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Than about your coming to Dieppe, you
mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean, than about me," he repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear man," said she, taking his hand,
"what&#39;s the matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You do wish I could come?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Must I say?" smiled Mrs. Dennison. "For
shame, Harry! You might be on your honeymoon."</p>

<p class="indent">He moved away, and flung himself into a chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair of Ruston," he broke out,
"to run away and leave it all to me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, you told him you could do it perfectly!
I heard you say so."</p>

<p class="indent">"How could I say anything else, when&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"And originally you were both to be away! After
all, you&#39;re not stopping because of Omofaga, but because
Sir George has got the gout."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison, convicted of folly, had no answer,
though he was hurt that he should be convicted
out of his wife&#39;s mouth. He shuffled his feet
about and began to whistle dolefully.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison looked at him with smothered impatience.
Their little boy behaved like that when he
was in a naughty mood&mdash;when he wanted the moon,
or something of that kind, and thought mother and
nurse cruel because it didn&#39;t come. Mrs. Dennison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
forgot that mother and nurse were fate to her little
boy, or she might have sympathised with his naughty
moods a little better.</p>

<p class="indent">She rose now and walked slowly over to her husband.
She had a hand on his chair, and was about to speak,
when he stopped his whistling and jerked out
abruptly,</p>

<p class="indent">"What did he mean about the kingdom?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison&#39;s hand slid away and fell by her
side. Harry caught her look of cold anger. He
leapt to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, I&#39;m a fool," he cried. "I don&#39;t know
what&#39;s wrong with me. Sit down here."</p>

<p class="indent">He made her sit, and half-crouched, half-knelt beside
her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie," he went on, "are you angry? Damn
the joke! I don&#39;t want to know. Are you sorry
I&#39;m not coming?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What a baby you are, Harry! Oh, yes, awfully
sorry."</p>

<p class="indent">He knew so well what he wanted to say: he
wanted to tell her that she was everything to him,
that to be out of her heart was death: that to feel
her slipping away was a torture: he wanted to woo
and win her over again&mdash;win her more truly than he
had even in those triumphant days when she gave
herself to him. He wanted to show her that he understood
her&mdash;that he was not a fool&mdash;that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
man enough for her! Yes, that she need not turn to
Ruston or anybody else. Oh, yes, he could understand
her, really he could.</p>

<p class="indent">Not a word of it would come. He dared not begin:
he feared that he would look&mdash;that she would
find him&mdash;more silly still, if he began to say that sort
of thing. She was smiling satirically now&mdash;indulgently
but satirically, and the emphasis of her purposely
childish "awfully" betrayed her estimation of
his question. She did not understand the mood.
She was accustomed to his admiration&mdash;worship
would hardly be too strong a word. But the implied
demand for a response to it seemed strange to her.
Her air bore in upon him the utter difference between
his thoughts of her and the way she thought about
him. Always dimly felt, it had never pressed on him
like this before.</p>

<p class="indent">"Really, I&#39;m very sorry, dear," she said, just a little
more seriously. "But it&#39;s only a fortnight. We&#39;re
not separating for ever," and her smile broke out
again.</p>

<p class="indent">With a queer feeling of hopelessness, he rose to
his feet. No, he couldn&#39;t make her feel it. He had
suffered in the same way over his speeches; he
couldn&#39;t make people feel them either. She didn&#39;t
understand. It was no use. He began to whistle
again, staring out of the open window.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall go to bed, Harry. I&#39;m tired. I&#39;ve been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
seeing that the maid&#39;s packed what I wanted, and it&#39;s
harder work than packing oneself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Give me a kiss, Meg," he said, turning round.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not do that, but she accepted his kiss, and
he, turning away abruptly, shaped his lips to resume
his tune. But now the tune wouldn&#39;t come. His
wife left him alone. The tune came when she was
there. Now it wouldn&#39;t. Ah, but the words would.
He muttered them inaudibly to himself as he stood
looking out of the window. They sounded as though
they must touch any woman&#39;s heart. With an oath
he threw himself on to the sofa, trying now to banish
the haunting words&mdash;the words that would not come
at his call, and came, in belated uselessness, to mock
him now. He lay still; and they ran through his
head. At last they ceased; but, before he could
thank God for that, a strange sense of desolation came
over him. He looked round the empty, silent room,
that seemed larger now than in its busy daylight
hours. The house was all still; there might have
been one lying dead in it. It might have been the
house of a man who had lost his wife.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>AGAINST HIS COMING.</h3>

<p class="indent">"The great Napoleon once observed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t quote from &#39;Anecdotes, New and Old,&#39;"
interrupted Adela unkindly.</p>

<p class="indent">"That when his death was announced," pursued
Lord Semingham, who thought it good for Adela to
take no notice of such interruptions, "everybody
would say <i>Ouf</i>. I say &#39;<i>Ouf</i>&#39; now," and he stretched
his arms luxuriously to their full length. "There&#39;s
room here," he added, explaining the gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, who&#39;s dead?" asked Adela, choosing to be
exasperatingly literal.</p>

<p class="indent">"Nobody&#39;s dead; but a lot of people&mdash;and things&mdash;are
a long way off."</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s not so satisfactorily final," said Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, but it serves for the time. Did you see me
on my bicycle this morning?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What, going round here?" and Adela waved her
hand circularly, as though embracing the broad path
that runs round the grass by the sea at Dieppe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;just behind a charming <i>Parisienne</i> in a
pair of&mdash;behind a charming <i>Parisienne</i> in an appropriate
costume."</p>

<p class="indent">"Bessie must get one," said Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good heavens!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean a bicycle."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, certainly, if she likes; but she&#39;d as soon
mount Salisbury Spire."</p>

<p class="indent">"How did you learn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I really beg your pardon," said Semingham,
"but the fact is&mdash;Ruston taught me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Let&#39;s change the subject," said Adela, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"A charming child, this Marjory Valentine," observed
Semingham. "She&#39;s too good for young Evan.
I&#39;m very glad she wouldn&#39;t have him."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re always sorry other girls don&#39;t marry.
Heaven knows why."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;m sorry she didn&#39;t take Evan."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t tell you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not&mdash;not the forbidden topic?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I half believe so."</p>

<p class="indent">"But she&#39;s here with Maggie Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, everybody doesn&#39;t chatter as you do," said
Adela incisively.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t believe it. She&mdash;&mdash;Hallo! here she
is!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Marjory Valentine came along, bending her slim
figure a little, the better to resist a fresh breeze that
blew her skirts out behind her, and threatened to
carry off her broad-brimmed hat. She had been bathing;
the water was warm, and her cheeks glowed with
a fine colour. As she came up, both Adela and Lord
Semingham put on their eyeglasses.</p>

<p class="indent">"An uncommon pretty girl," observed the latter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Isn&#39;t it glorious?" cried Marjory, yet several yards
away. "Walter will enjoy the bathing tremendously."</p>

<p class="indent">"When&#39;s he coming?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Saturday," answered Marjory. "Where is Lady
Semingham?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dressing," said Semingham solemnly. "Costume
number one, off at 11.30. Costume number two,
on at 12. Costume number two, off at 3.30. Costume&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"After all, she&#39;s your wife," said Adela, in tones of
grave reproach.</p>

<p class="indent">"But for that, I shouldn&#39;t have a word to say
against it. Women are very queer reasoners."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory sat down next to Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Women do waste a lot of time on dress, don&#39;t
they?" she asked, in a meditative tone; "and a lot of
thought, too!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo!" exclaimed Lord Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean, thought they might give to really important
things. You can&#39;t imagine George Eliot&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"What about Queen Elizabeth?" interrupted
Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"She was a horrible woman," said Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Phryne attached no importance to it," added
Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I forgot! Tell me about her," cried Marjory.</p>

<p class="indent">"A strong-minded woman, Miss Marjory."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s talking nonsense, Marjory."</p>

<p class="indent">"I supplied a historical instance in Miss Valentine&#39;s
favour."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall look her up," said Marjory, at which Lord
Semingham smiled in quiet amusement. He was a
man who saw his joke a long way off, and could wait
patiently for it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, do," he said, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela had grown grave, and was watching the
girl&#39;s face. It was a pretty face, and not a silly one;
and Marjory&#39;s blue eyes gazed out to sea, as though
she were looking at something a great way off. Adela,
with a frown of impatience, turned to her other neighbour.
She would not be troubled with aspirations
there. In fact, she was still annoyed with her young
friend on Evan Haselden&#39;s account. But it was no
use turning to Lord Semingham. His eyes were
more than half-closed, and he was beating time gently
to the Casino band, audible in the distance. Adela
sighed. At last Marjory broke the silence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"When Mr. Ruston comes," she began, "I shall
ask him whether&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The sentence was not finished.</p>

<p class="indent">"When who comes?" cried Adela; and Semingham
opened his eyes and stilled his foot-pats.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is he coming after all? I thought, now that
Dennison&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes&mdash;he&#39;s coming with Walter. Didn&#39;t you
know?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Is he coming to-day?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose so. Aren&#39;t you glad?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course," from Adela, and "Oh, uncommonly,"
from Lord Semingham, seemed at first sight answers
satisfactory enough; but Marjory&#39;s inquiring gaze
rested on their faces.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come for a stroll," said Adela abruptly, and passing
her arm through Marjory&#39;s, she made her rise.
Semingham, having gasped out his conventional reply,
sat like a man of stone, but Adela, for all that it was
needless, whispered imperatively, "Stay where you
are."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Marjory," she went on, as they began to
walk, "I don&#39;t know that I am glad after all."</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe you don&#39;t like him."</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe I don&#39;t," said Adela slowly. It was a
point she had not yet quite decided.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t use to."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"But you do now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela hated the pregnant brevity of this affirmative.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mamma doesn&#39;t," laughed Marjory. "She&#39;s so
angry with him carrying off Walter. As if it wasn&#39;t a
grand thing for Walter! So she&#39;s quite turned round
about him."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s not staying in&mdash;with you, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no. Though I don&#39;t see why he shouldn&#39;t.
Conventions are so stupid, aren&#39;t they? Mrs. Dennison&#39;s
there," and Marjory looked up with an appeal to
calm reason as personified in Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">At another time, nineteen&#39;s view of twenty-nine&mdash;Marjory&#39;s
conception of Maggie Dennison as a sufficing
chaperon&mdash;would have amused Adela. But she
was past amusement. Her patience snapped, as it
were, in two. She turned almost fiercely on her
companion, forgetting all prudence in her irritation.</p>

<p class="indent">"For heaven&#39;s sake, child, what do you mean?
Do you think he&#39;s coming to see you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory drew her arm out from Adela&#39;s, and retreated
a step from her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Adela! I never thought&mdash;&mdash;" She did not end,
conscious, perhaps, that her flushed face gave her
words the lie. Adela swept on.</p>

<p class="indent">"You! He&#39;s not coming to see you. I don&#39;t believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
he&#39;s coming to see anyone&mdash;no, not even Maggie&mdash;I
mean no one, at all."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl&#39;s look marked the fatal slip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" she gasped, just audibly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t believe he cares <i>that</i> for any of us&mdash;for
anyone alive. Marjory, I didn&#39;t mean what I said
about Maggie, I didn&#39;t indeed. Don&#39;t look like that.
Oh, what a stupid girl you are!" and she ended with a
half-hysterical laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">For some moments they stood facing one another,
saying nothing. The meaning of Adela&#39;s words was
sinking into Marjory&#39;s mind.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let&#39;s walk on. People will wonder," said she at
last; and she enlaced Adela&#39;s arm again. After another
long pause, during which her face expressed the
turmoil of her thoughts, she whispered,</p>

<p class="indent">"Adela, is that why Mr. Loring went away?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know why he went away."</p>

<p class="indent">"You think me a child, so you say you don&#39;t mean
it now. You do mean it, you know. You wouldn&#39;t
say a thing like that for nothing. Tell me what you
do mean, Adela." It was almost an order. Adela
suddenly realised that she had struck down to a
force and a character. "Tell me exactly what you
mean," insisted Marjory; "you ought to tell me,
Adela."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela found herself obeying.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know about him; but I&#39;m afraid of her,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
she stammered, as if confessing a shameful deed of
her own. A moment later she broke into entreaty.
"Go away, dear. Don&#39;t get mixed up in it. Don&#39;t
have anything to do with him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you go away when your friends are in trouble
or in danger?"</p>

<p class="indent">Adela felt suddenly small&mdash;then wise&mdash;then small
because her wisdom was of a small kind. Yet she
gave it utterance.</p>

<p class="indent">"But, Marjory, think of&mdash;think of yourself. If
you&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know what you&#39;re going to say. If I care for
him? I don&#39;t. I hardly know him. But, if I did, I
might&mdash;I might be of some use. And are you going
to leave her all alone? I thought you were her
friend. Are you just going to look on? Though you
think&mdash;what you think!"</p>

<p class="indent">Adela caught hold of the girl&#39;s hands. There was
a choking in her throat, and she could say nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">"But if he sees?" she murmured, when she found
speech.</p>

<p class="indent">"He won&#39;t see. There&#39;s nothing to see. I shan&#39;t
show it. Adela, I shall stay. Why do you think
what&mdash;what you think?"</p>

<p class="indent">People might wonder, if they would&mdash;perhaps they
did&mdash;when Adela drew Marjory towards her, and
kissed her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"I couldn&#39;t, my dear," she said, "but, if you can,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
for heaven&#39;s sake do. I may be wrong, but&mdash;I&#39;m uneasy."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory&#39;s lips quivered, but she held her head
proudly up; then she sobbed a short quick-stifled sob,
and then smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"I daresay it&#39;s not a bit true," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela pressed her hand again, saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m an emotional old creature."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why did Mr. Loring go away?" demanded Marjory.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. He thought it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Best? Well, he was wrong."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela could not hear Tom attacked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie turned him out," she said&mdash;which account
of the matter was, perhaps, just a little one-sided,
though containing a part of the truth. Marjory
meditated on it for a moment, Adela still covertly
looking at her. The discovery was very strange.
Half-an-hour ago she had smiled because the girl
hinted a longing after something beyond frocks, and
had laughed at her simple acceptance of Semingham&#39;s
joke. Now she found herself turning to her, looking
to her for help in the trouble that had puzzled her.
In her admiration of the girl&#39;s courage, she forgot to
wonder at her intuition, her grasp of evil possibilities,
the knowledge of Maggie Dennison that her resolve
implied. Adda watched her, as, their farewell said,
she walked, first quickly, then very slowly, towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
the villa which Mrs. Dennison had hired, on the cliff-side,
near the old Castle. Then, with a last sigh, she
put up her parasol and sauntered back to the Hôtel
de Rome. Costume number two would be on by now,
and Bessie Semingham ready for luncheon.</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory, finally sunk into the slow gait that means
either idleness or deep thought, made her way up to
the villa. With every step she drew nearer, the burden
she had taken up seemed heavier. It was not sorrow
for the dawning dream that the storm-cloud had
eclipsed that she really thought of. But the task
loomed large in its true difficulty, as her first enthusiasm
spent itself. If Adela were right, what could
she do? If Adela were wrong, what unpardonable
offence she might give. Ah, was Adela right?
Strange and new as the idea was, there was an unquestioning
conviction in her manner that Marjory could
hardly resist. Save under the stress of a conviction,
speech on such a matter would have been an impossible
crime. And Marjory remembered, with a sinking
heart, Maggie Dennison&#39;s smile of happy triumph
when she read out the lines in which Ruston told of
his coming. Yes, it was, or it might be, true. But
where lay her power to help?</p>

<p class="indent">Coming round the elbow of the rising path, she
caught sight of Maggie Dennison sitting in the garden.
Mrs. Dennison wore white; her pale, clear-cut
profile was towards Marjory; she rested her chin on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
her hand, and her elbow on her knee, and she was
looking on the ground. Softly Marjory drew near.
An unopened letter from Harry lay on a little table;
the children had begun their mid-day meal in the
room, whose open window was but a few feet behind;
Mrs. Dennison&#39;s thoughts were far away. Marjory
stopped short. A stronger buffet of fear, a more overwhelming
sense of helplessness, smote her. She understood
better why Adela had been driven to do
nothing&mdash;to look on. She smiled for an instant; the
idea put itself so whimsically; but she thought that,
had Mrs. Dennison been walking over a precipice, it
would need all one&#39;s courage to interfere with her.
She would think it such an impertinence. And Ruston?
Marjory saw, all in a minute, his cheerful
scorn, his unshaken determination, his rapid dismissal
of one more obstacle. She drew in her breath in a
long inspiration, and Mrs. Dennison raised her eyes
and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe I felt you there," she said, smiling. "At
least, I began to think of you."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory sat near her hostess.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you meet anyone?" asked Mrs. Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"Adela Ferrars and Lord Semingham."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, had they anything to say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;I don&#39;t think so," she answered slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">"What should they have to say in this place?
The children have begun. Aren&#39;t you hungry?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Not very."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I am," and Mrs. Dennison arose. "I forgot
it, but I am."</p>

<p class="indent">"They didn&#39;t know Mr. Ruston was coming."</p>

<p class="indent">"Didn&#39;t they?" smiled Mrs. Dennison. "And
has Adela forgiven you? Oh, you know, the poor boy
is a friend of hers, as he is of mine."</p>

<p class="indent">"We didn&#39;t talk about it."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you don&#39;t want to? Very well, we won&#39;t.
See, here&#39;s a long letter&mdash;it&#39;s very heavy, at least&mdash;from
Harry. I must read it afterwards."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps it&#39;s to say he can come sooner."</p>

<p class="indent">"I expect not," said Mrs. Dennison, and she opened
the letter. "No; a fortnight hence at the soonest,"
she announced, after reading a few lines.</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory was both looking and listening closely,
but she detected neither disappointment nor relief.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s seen Tom Loring! Oh, and Tom sends me
his best remembrances. Poor Tom! Marjory, does
Adela talk about Mr. Loring?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She mentioned him once."</p>

<p class="indent">"She thinks it was all my fault," laughed Mrs.
Dennison. "A woman always thinks it&#39;s a woman&#39;s
fault; at least, that&#39;s our natural tendency, though
we&#39;re being taught to overcome it. Marjory, you
look dull! It will be livelier for you when your
brother and Mr. Ruston come."</p>

<p class="indent">The hardest thing about great resolves and lofty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
moods is their intermixture with everyday life. The
intervals, the "waits," the mass of irrelevant trivialities
that life inartistically mingles with its drama,
flinging down pell-mell a heap of great and small&mdash;these
cool courage and make discernment distrust
itself. Mrs. Dennison seemed so quiet, so placid, so
completely the affectionate but not anxious wife, the
kind hostess, and even the human gossip, that Marjory
wanted to rub her eyes, wondering if all her
heroics were nonsense&mdash;a girl&#39;s romance gone wrong.
There was nothing to be done but eat and drink, and
talk and lounge in the sun&mdash;there was no hint of a
drama, no call for a rescue, no place for a sacrifice.
And Marjory had been all aglow to begin. Her face
grew dull and her eyelids half-dropped as she leant
her head on the back of her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Déjeuner!</i>" cried Mrs. Dennison merrily. "And
this afternoon we&#39;re all going to gamble at <i>petits chevaux</i>,
and if we win we&#39;re going to buy more Omofagas.
There&#39;s a picture of a speculator&#39;s family!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Dennison&#39;s not a speculator, is he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, it depends on what you mean. Anyhow, I
am;" and Mrs. Dennison, waving her letter in the air
and singing softly, almost danced in her merry walk
to the house. Then, crying her last words, "Be
quick!" from the door, she disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later she was laughing and chattering
to her children. Marjory heard her burlesque complaints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
over the utter disappearance of an omelette
she had set her heart upon.</p>

<p class="indent">That afternoon they all played at <i>petits chevaux</i>,
and the only one to win was Madge. But Madge
utterly refused to invest her gains in Omofagas. She
assigned no reasons, slating that her mother did not
like her to declare the feeling which influenced her,
and Mrs. Dennison laughed again. But Adela Ferrars
would not look towards Marjory, but kept her
eyes on an old gentleman who had been playing also,
and playing with good fortune. He had looked round
curiously when, in the course of the chaff, they had
mentioned Omofaga, and Adela detected in him the
wish to look again. She wondered who he was, scrutinising
his faded blue eyes and the wrinkles of weariness
on his brow. Willie Ruston could have told her.
It was Baron von Geltschmidt of Frankfort.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>IT CAN WAIT.</h3>

<p class="indent">In all things evil and good, to the world, and&mdash;a
thing quite rare&mdash;to himself, Willie Ruston was an
unaffected man. Success, the evidence of power and
the earnest of more power, gave him his greatest pleasure,
and he received it with his greatest and most
open satisfaction. It did not surprise him, but it
elated him, and his habit was to conceal neither the
presence of elation nor the absence of surprise. That
irony in the old sense, which means the well-bred
though hardly sincere depreciation of a man&#39;s own
qualities and achievements, was not his. When he
had done anything, he liked to dine with his friends
and talk it over. He had been sharing the Carlins&#39;
unfashionable six o&#39;clock meal at Hampstead this
evening, and had taken the train to Baker Street, and
was now sauntering home with a cigar. He had talked
the whole thing over with them. Carlin had said
that no one could have managed the affair so well as
he had, and Mrs. Carlin had not once referred to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
lost <i>tabula in naufragio</i>, the coal business. Yes, his
attack on London had been a success. He had known
nothing of London, save that its denizens were human
beings, and that knowledge, whether in business or
society, had been enough. His great scheme was
floated; a few months more would see him in Omofaga;
there was money to last for a long time to
come; and he had been cordially received and even
made a lion of in the drawing-rooms. They would
look for his name in the papers ("and find it, by
Jove," he interpolated). Men in high places would
think of him when there was a job to be "put
through;" and women, famous in regions inaccessible
to the vulgar, would recollect their talks with
Mr. Ruston. Decidedly they were human beings, and
therefore, raw as he was (he just knew that he had
come to them a little raw), he had succeeded.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet they were, some of them, strange folk. There
were complications in them which he found it necessary
to reconnoitre. They said a great many things
which they did not think, and, <i>en revanche</i>, would
often only hint what they did. And&mdash;&mdash;But here he
yawned, and, finding his cigar out, relit it. He was
not in the mood for analysing his acquaintance. He
let his fancy play more lightly. It was evening, and
work was done. He liked London evenings. He had
liked bandying repartees with Adela Ferrars (though
she had been too much for him if she could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
kept her temper); he liked talking to Marjory Valentine
and seeing her occupied with his ideas. Most
of all, he liked trying to catch Maggie Dennison&#39;s
thought as it flashed out for a moment, and fled
to shelter again. He had laughed again and again
over the talk that Tom Loring had interrupted&mdash;and
not less because of the interruption. There was little
malice in him, and he bore no grudge against Tom.
Even his anger at the Omofaga articles had been
chiefly for public purposes and public consumption.
It was always somebody&#39;s "game" to spoil his game,
and one must not quarrel with men for playing their
own hands. Tom amused him, and had amused him,
especially by his behaviour over that talk. No doubt
the position had looked a strange one. Tom had
been so shocked. Poor Tom, it must be very serious
to be so easily shocked. Mr. Ruston was not easily
shocked.</p>

<p class="indent">Unaffected, free from self-consciousness, undividedly
bent on his schemes, unheeding of everything
but their accomplishment, he had spent little time in
considering the considerable stir which he had, in
fact, created in the circle of his more intimate associates.
They had proved pliable and pleasant, and
these were the qualities he liked in his neighbours.
They said agreeable things to him, and they did what
he wanted. He had stayed not (save once, and half
in jest, with Maggie Dennison) to inquire why, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
the quasi-real, quasi-burlesque apprehension of him&mdash;burlesqued
perhaps lest it should seem too real&mdash;which
had grown up among such close observers as
Adela Ferrars and Semingham, would have struck
him as absurd, the outcome of that idle business of
brain which weaves webs of fine fancies round the
obvious, and loses the power of action in the fascination
of self-created puzzles. The <i>nuances</i> of a woman&#39;s
attraction towards a man, whether it be admiration,
or interest, or pass beyond&mdash;whether it be liking
and just not love&mdash;or interest running into love&mdash;or
love masquerading as interest, or what-not, Willie
Ruston recked little of. He was a man, and a young
man. He liked women and clever women&mdash;yes, and
handsome women. But to spend your time thinking
of or about women, or, worse still, of or about what
women thought of you, seemed poor economy of precious
days&mdash;amusing to do, maybe, in spare hours,
inevitable now and again&mdash;but to be driven or laughed
away when there was work to be done.</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the colour of his floating thoughts, and
the loose-hung meditation brought him to his own
dwelling, in a great building which overlooked Hyde
Park. He lived high up in a small, irregular, many-cornered
room, sparely-furnished, dull and pictureless.
The only thing hanging on the walls was a large scale
map of Omofaga and the neighbouring territories; in
lieu of nicnacks there stood on the mantlepiece lumps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
of ore, specimens from the mines of Omofaga (would
not these convince the most obstinate unbeliever?),
and half-smothered by ill-dusted papers, a small photograph
of Ruston and a potent Omofagan chief seated
on the ground with a large piece of paper before them&mdash;a
treaty no doubt. A well-worn sofa, second-hand
and soft, and a deep arm-chair redeemed the place
from utter comfortlessness, but it was plain that
beauty in his daily surroundings was not essential to
Willie Ruston. He did not notice furniture.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked in briskly, but stopped short with his
hand still on the knob of the door. Harry Dennison
lay on the sofa, with his arm flung across his face.
He sprang up on Ruston&#39;s entrance.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo! Been here long? I&#39;ve been dining with
Carlin," said Ruston, and, going to a cupboard, he
brought out whisky and soda water.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison began to explain his presence.
In the first place he had nothing to do; in the second
he wanted someone to talk to; in the third&mdash;at last
he blurted it out&mdash;the first, second, third and only
reason for his presence.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t believe I can manage alone in town," he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not manage? There&#39;s nothing to do. And
Carlin&#39;s here."</p>

<p class="indent">"You see I&#39;ve got other work besides Omofaga,"
pleaded Harry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I know Dennisons have lots of irons in the
fire. But Omofaga won&#39;t trouble you. I&#39;ve told Carlin
to wire me if any news comes, and I can be back
in a few hours."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry had come to suggest that the expedition to
Dieppe should be abandoned for a week or two. He
got no chance and sat silent.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s all done," continued Ruston. "The stores
are all on their way. Jackson is waiting for them
on the coast. Why, the train will start inland in a
couple of months from now. They&#39;ll go very slow
though. I shall catch them up all right."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry brightened a little.</p>

<p class="indent">"Belford said it was uncertain when you would
start," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"It may be uncertain to Belford, it&#39;s not to me,"
observed Mr. Ruston, lighting his pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">The speech sounded unkind; but Mr. Belford&#39;s
mind dwelt in uncertainty contentedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you think of&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear Dennison, I don&#39;t &#39;think&#39; at all. To-day&#39;s
the 12th of August. Happen what may, I sail
on the 10th of November. Nothing will keep me
after that&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p class="indent">"Belford started for the Engadine to-day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he won&#39;t worry you then. Let it alone, my
dear fellow. It&#39;s all right."</p>

<p class="indent">Clearly Mr. Ruston meant to go to Dieppe. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
was now to Harry Dennison bad news; but he meant
to go to Omofaga also, and to go soon; that was good.
Harry, however, had still something that he wished to
convey&mdash;a bit of diplomacy to carry out.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope you&#39;ll find Maggie better," he began.
"She was rather knocked up when she went."</p>

<p class="indent">"A few days will have put her all right," responded
Ruston cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">He was never ill and treated fatigue with a cheery
incredulousness. But, at least, he spoke with an utter
absence of undue anxiety on the score of another
man&#39;s wife.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison, primed by Mrs. Cormack&#39;s suggestions,
went on,</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish you&#39;d talk to her as little as you can about
Omofaga. She&#39;s very interested in it, you know, and&mdash;and
very excitable&mdash;and all that. We want her
mind to get a complete rest."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hum. I expect, then, I mustn&#39;t talk to her at
all."</p>

<p class="indent">The manifest impossibility of making such a request
did not prevent Harry yearning after it.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t ask that," he said, smiling weakly.</p>

<p class="indent">"It won&#39;t hurt her," said Willie Ruston. "And
she likes it."</p>

<p class="indent">She liked it beyond question.</p>

<p class="indent">"It tires her," Harry persisted. "It&mdash;it gets on
her nerves. It absorbs her too much."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span></p>

<p class="indent">His face was turned up to Ruston. As he spoke
the last words, Ruston directed his eyes, suddenly and
rapidly, upon him. Harry could not escape the encounter
of eyes; hastily he averted his head, and his
face flushed. Ruston continued to look at him, a
slight smile on his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Absorbs her?" he repeated slowly, fingering his
beard.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you know what I mean."</p>

<p class="indent">Another long stare showed Ruston&#39;s meditative
preoccupation. Harry sat uncomfortable under it,
wishing he had not let fall the word.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;ll be careful," said Ruston at last.
"Anything else?"</p>

<p class="indent">Harry rose. Ruston carried an atmosphere of
business about with him, and the visit seemed naturally
to end with the business of it. Taking his hat,
Harry moved towards the door. Then, pausing, he
smiled in an embarrassed way, and remarked,</p>

<p class="indent">"You can talk to Marjory Valentine, you
know."</p>

<p class="indent">"So I can. She&#39;s a nice girl."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry twirled his hat in his fingers. His brain
had conceived more diplomacy.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;ll be a fine chance for you to win her heart,"
he suggested with a tentative laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"I might do worse," said Willie Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"You might&mdash;much worse," said Harry eagerly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Aren&#39;t you rather giving away your friend young
Haselden?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Who told you, Ruston?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lady Val. Who told you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Semingham."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! Well, what would Haselden say to your
idea?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, she won&#39;t have him&mdash;he&#39;s got no chance
anyhow."</p>

<p class="indent">"All right. I&#39;ll think about it. Good-night."</p>

<p class="indent">He watched his guest depart, but did not accompany
him on his way, and, left alone, sat down in the
deep arm-chair. His smile was still on his lips. Poor
Harry Dennison was a transparent schemer&mdash;one of
those whose clumsy efforts to avert what they fear
effects naught save to suggest the doing of it. Yet
Willie Ruston&#39;s smile had more pity than scorn in it.
True, it had more of amusement than of either. He
could have taken a slate and written down all Harry&#39;s
thoughts during the interview. But whence had
come the change? Why had Dennison himself
bidden him to Dieppe, to come now, a fortnight
later, and beg him not to go? Why did he now
desire his wife to hear no more of Omofaga, whose
chief delight in it had been that it caught her fancy
and imparted to him some of the interest she found
in it? Ruston saw in the transformation the working
of another mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Somebody&#39;s been putting it into his head," he
muttered, still half-amused, but now half-angry also.</p>

<p class="indent">And, with his usual rapidity of judgment, he
darted unhesitatingly to a conclusion. He identified
the hand in the business; he recognised whose more
subtle thoughts Harry Dennison had stumbled over
and mauled in his painful devices. But to none is it
given to be infallible, and want of doubt does not
always mean absence of error. Forgetting this commonplace
truth, Willie Ruston slapped his thigh,
leapt up from his chair and, standing on the rug,
exclaimed,</p>

<p class="indent">"Loring&mdash;by Jove!"</p>

<p class="indent">It was clear to him. Loring was his enemy; he
had displaced Loring. Loring hated him and Omofaga.
Loring had stirred a husband&#39;s jealousy to
further his own grudge. The same temper of mind
that made his anger fade away when he had arrived at
this certainty, prevented any surprise at the discovery.
It was natural in man to seek revenge, to use the
nearest weapon, to counter stroke with stroke, not to
throw away any advantages for the sake of foibles of
generosity. So, then, it was Loring who bade him
not go to Dieppe, who prayed him to not to "absorb"
Mrs. Dennison in Omofaga, who was ready, notwithstanding
his hatred and distrust, to see him the lover
of Marjory Valentine sooner than the too engrossing
friend of Mrs. Dennison! What a fool they must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
think him!&mdash;and, with this reflection, he put the whole
matter out of his head. It could wait till he was at
Dieppe, and, taking hold of the great map by the
roller at the bottom, he drew it to him. Then he
reached and lifted the lamp from the table, and set it
high on the mantlepiece. Its light shone now on his
path, and with his finger he traced the red line that
ran, curving and winding, inwards from the coast,
till it touched the blue letters of the "Omofaga" that
sprawled across the map. The line ended in a cross
of red paint. The cross was Fort Imperial&mdash;was to
be Fort Imperial, at least; but Willie Ruston&#39;s mind
overleapt all difference of tenses. He stood and looked,
pulling hard and fast at his pipe. He was there&mdash;there
in Fort Imperial already&mdash;far away from London
and London folk&mdash;from weak husbands and their
causes of anxiety&mdash;from the pleasing recreations of
fascinating society, from the covert attacks of men
whose noses he had put out of joint. He forgot them
all; their feelings became naught to him. What
mattered their graces, their assaults, their weal or
woe? He was in Omofaga, carving out of its rock a
stable seat, carving on the rock face, above the seat,
a name that should live.</p>

<p class="indent">At last he turned away, flinging his empty pipe
on the table and dropping the map from his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall go to bed," he said. "Three months
more of it!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span></p>

<p class="indent">And to bed he went, never having thought once
during the whole evening of a French lady, who
liked to get amusement out of her neighbours, and
had stayed in town on purpose to have some more
talks with Harry Dennison. Had Willie Ruston not
been quite so sure that he read Tom Loring&#39;s character
aright, he might have spared a thought for Mrs. Cormack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>A SPASM OF PENITENCE.</h3>

<p class="indent">Tom Loring had arranged to spend the whole of
the autumn in London. His Omofaga articles had
gained such favourable notice that his editor had
engaged him to contribute a series dealing with
African questions and African companies (and the
latter are in the habit of producing the former), while
he was occupied, on his own account, at the British
Museum, in making way with a treatise of a politico-philosophical
description, which had been in his head
for several years. He hailed with pleasure the
prospect of getting on with it; the leisure afforded
him by his departure from the Dennisons was, in its
way, a consolation for the wrench involved in the
parting. Could he have felt more at ease about the
course of events in his absence, he would have endured
his sojourn in town with equanimity.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, the place was fast becoming a desert,
but, at this moment, chance, which always objects to
our taking things for granted, brought a carriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
exactly opposite the bench on which Tom was seated,
and he heard his name called in a high-pitched voice
that he recognised. Looking up, he saw Mrs. Cormack
leaning over the side of her victoria, smiling
effusively and beckoning to him. That everyone
should go save Mrs. Cormack seemed to Tom the
irony of circumstance. With a mutter to himself, he
rose and walked up to the carriage. He then perceived,
to his surprise, that it contained, hidden
behind Mrs. Cormack&#39;s sleeves&mdash;sleeves were large
that year&mdash;another inmate. It was Evan Haselden,
and he greeted Tom with an off-hand nod.</p>

<p class="indent">"The good God," cried Mrs. Cormack, "evidently
kept me here to console young men! Are you left
desolate like Mr. Haselden here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, it&#39;s not very lively," responded Tom, as
amiably as he could.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, it isn&#39;t," she agreed, with the slightest,
quickest glance at Evan, who was staring moodily at
the tops of the trees.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom laughed. The woman amused him in spite
of himself. And her failures to extract entertainment
from poor heart-broken Evan struck him as
humorous.</p>

<p class="indent">"But I&#39;m at work," he went on, "so I don&#39;t
mind."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! Are you still crushing&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," interrupted Tom quickly. "That&#39;s done."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I should not have guessed it," said Mrs. Cormack,
opening her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean, I&#39;ve finished the articles on that point."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is rather a different thing," laughed she.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m afraid so," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish to heaven it wasn&#39;t!" ejaculated Evan
suddenly, without shifting his gaze from the treetops.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, he is very very bad," whispered Mrs. Cormack.
"Poor young man! Are you bad too?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but I know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no, you don&#39;t," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Evan rose, opened the carriage door, got
out, shut it, and lifted his hat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye," said Mrs. Cormack, smiling merrily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye. Thanks," said Evan, with unchanged
melancholy, and, with another nod to Tom, he walked
round to the path and strode quickly away.</p>

<p class="indent">"How absurd!" said she.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not at all. I like to see him honest about it.
He&#39;s hard hit&mdash;and he&#39;s not ashamed of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well," said Mrs. Cormack, shrugging the
subject away in weariness of it. "And how do you
stand banishment? Will you get in?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, if you won&#39;t assume&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Too great familiarity, Mr. Loring?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I was only going to say&mdash;with my affairs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
With me&mdash;I should be charmed," and Tom settled
himself in the victoria.</p>

<p class="indent">He had, now he came to think of it, been really
very much bored; and the little woman was quite a
resource.</p>

<p class="indent">She rewarded his ironical gallantry with a look
that told him she took it for what it was worth, but
liked it all the same; and, after a pause, asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"And you see Mr. Dennison often?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Very seldom, on the contrary. I don&#39;t know
what he does with himself."</p>

<p class="indent">"The poor man! He walks up and down. I
hear him walking up and down."</p>

<p class="indent">"What does he do that for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! what? Well, he cannot be happy, can
he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Can&#39;t he?" said Tom, determined to understand
nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are very discreet," she said, with a malicious
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m obliged to be. Somebody must be."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Loring," she said abruptly, "you don&#39;t like
me, neither you nor Miss Ferrars."</p>

<p class="indent">"I never answer for others. For myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I know. What does it matter? Well, anyhow,
I&#39;m sorry for that poor man."</p>

<p class="indent">"Your sympathy is very ready, Mrs. Cormack."</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean it is too soon&mdash;premature?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I mean it&#39;s altogether unnecessary, to my humble
thinking."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I&#39;m not a fool," she protested.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom could not help laughing. The laugh, however,
rather spoilt his argument.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have it your own way," he conceded, conscious
of his error, and trying to cover it by a burlesque surrender.
"He&#39;s miserable."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he is."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a placid certainty about her that disturbed
Tom&#39;s attitude of incredulity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why is he?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have talked to him. I know," she answered,
with a nod full of meaning.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, have you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and he&mdash;well, do you want to hear, or will
you be angry and despise me as you used?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I want to hear."</p>

<p class="indent">"What did I use to say? That the man would
come? Well, he has come. <i>Voilà tout!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, so you say. But Harry doesn&#39;t think such&mdash;I
beg pardon, I was about to say, nonsense."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, he does. At least, he is afraid of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"How do you know?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I tell you, we have talked. And I saw. He almost
cried that he couldn&#39;t go to Dieppe, and that
somebody else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Tom suddenly turned upon her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Who began the talk?" he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Who began?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, what nonsense! Who does begin to talk?
How do I know? It came, Mr. Loring."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom said nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">"You look as if you didn&#39;t believe me," she remarked,
pouting.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t. He&#39;s the most unsuspicious fellow
alive."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, if you like, I began. I&#39;m not ashamed.
But I said very little. When he asked me if I thought
it good that she and&mdash;the other&mdash;should be together
out there and he here&mdash;well, was I to say yes?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think," observed Tom, in quiet and deliberate
tones, "that it&#39;s a great pity that some women can&#39;t
be gagged."</p>

<p class="indent">"They can, but only with kisses," said Mrs. Cormack,
not at all offended. "Oh, don&#39;t be frightened.
I do not wish to be gagged at all. If I did&mdash;there is
more than one man in the world."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom despised and half-hated her; but he liked
her good-nature, and, in his heart, admired her for not
flinching. Her shamelessness was crossed with courage.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you&#39;ve made him miserable?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I might say, I, a wicked Frenchwoman,
that it is better to be deceived than to be wretched.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
But you, an Englishman&mdash;&mdash;! Oh, never, Mr. Loring!"</p>

<p class="indent">Tom sat silent a little while.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know what to do," he said, half in reverie.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who thought you would?" asked Mrs. Cormack,
unkindly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe it&#39;s all a mare&#39;s nest."</p>

<p class="indent">"That means a mistake, a delusion?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It does."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I don&#39;t think you do believe it. And, if
you do, you are wrong. It is not all a&mdash;a mare&#39;s
nest."</p>

<p class="indent">She pronounced the word with unfamiliar delicateness.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom knew that he did not believe that it was all
a mare&#39;s nest. He would have given everything in
the world&mdash;save one thing&mdash;and that, he thought, he
had not got&mdash;to believe it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, if you believed it, why didn&#39;t you do
something?" he asked rather fiercely.</p>

<p class="indent">"What have you all done? I, at least, warned
him. Yes, since you insist, I hinted it. But you&mdash;you
ran away; and your Adela Ferrars, she looks
prim and pained, oh! and shocked, and doesn&#39;t come
so much."</p>

<p class="indent">It was a queer source to learn lessons from, and
Tom was no less surprised than Adela had been a
day or two before at Dieppe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"What should you do?" he asked, in new-born
humility.</p>

<p class="indent">"I? Nothing. What is it to me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What should you do, if you were me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Make love to her myself," smiled Mrs. Cormack.
She was having her revenge on Tom for many a scornful
speech.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you&#39;d held your tongue, it would all have
blown over!" he exclaimed in exasperation.</p>

<p class="indent">"It will blow over still; but it will blow first," she
said. "If that contents you, hold your tongue."</p>

<p class="indent">Then she turned to Tom, and laid a small fore-finger
on his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mark this," said she, "he does not care for her.
He cares for himself; she is&mdash;what would you say?
an incident&mdash;an accident&mdash;I do not know how to say
it&mdash;to him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, if you&#39;re right there&mdash;&mdash;" began Tom in
some relief.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I&#39;m right there, it will make no difference&mdash;at
first. But, as you say, it will blow over&mdash;and
sooner."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom looked at her, and thought, and looked
again.</p>

<p class="indent">"By Jove, you&#39;re not a fool, Mrs. Cormack," said
he, almost under his breath.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he added, louder,</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s the wisdom of the devil."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you surpass yourself," she smiled. "Your
compliments are magnificent."</p>

<p class="indent">"You must have learnt it from him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no. From my husband," said Mrs. Cormack.</p>

<p class="indent">The carriage, which during their talk had moved
slowly round the circle, stopped again.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack turned to Tom. He was already
looking at her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t understand you," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"No? Well, you&#39;ll hardly believe it, but that
does not surprise me."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not sure you don&#39;t mean well, if you weren&#39;t
ashamed to confess it," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time since he had known her, she
blushed and looked embarrassed. Then she began, in
a quick tone,</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I talked. I wanted to see how he took it;
and it amused me. And&mdash;well, our dear Maggie&mdash;she
is so very magnificent at times. She looks down so
calmly&mdash;oh! from such a height&mdash;on one. She had
told me that day&mdash;well, never mind that; it was true,
I daresay. I don&#39;t love truth. I don&#39;t see what right
people have to say things to me, just because one
may know they are true."</p>

<p class="indent">"So you made a little mischief?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I hear that poor man walking up and
down. I want to comfort him. I asked him to come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
in, and he refused. Then I offered to go in&mdash;he was
very frightened. Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>!" and she laughed
almost hysterically.</p>

<p class="indent">This very indirect confession proved in the end to
be all that Mrs. Cormack&#39;s penitence could drive her
to, and Tom left her, feeling a little softened towards
her, but hardly better equipped for action. What,
indeed, could be done? Tom&#39;s sense of futility expressed
itself in a long letter to Adela Ferrars. As
he had no suggestions for present action, he took
refuge in future promises.</p>

<p class="indent">"It will be very awkward for me to come, but if,
as time goes on, you think I should be any good, I
will come."</p>

<p class="indent">And Adela, when she read it, was tempted to send
for him on the spot; he would have been of no use,
but he would have comforted her. But then his presence
would unquestionably exasperate Maggie Dennison.
Adela decided to wait.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, by the time Tom Loring&#39;s letter reached
Dieppe, young Sir Walter and Willie Ruston were on
the boat, and they arrived hard on its heels. They
took up their abode at a hotel a few doors from where
the Seminghams were staying, and Walter at once
went round to pay his respects.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston stayed in to write letters. So he said; but
when he was alone he stood smoking at the window
and looking at the people down below. Presently, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
his surprise, he saw the same old gentleman whom
Adela had noticed in the Casino.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Baron, by Jove!" he exclaimed. "Now,
what brings him here?"</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron was sauntering slowly by, wrapped in a
cloak, and leaning heavily on a malacca cane. In a
moment Willie Ruston was down the stairs and after
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearing his name cried, the Baron stopped and
turned round.</p>

<p class="indent">"What chance brings you here?" asked Willie,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, hardly chance," said the Baron. "I always
go to some seaside place, and I thought I might meet
friends here," and he smiled significantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Ruston, after a pause; "I believe I
did mention it in Threadneedle Street. I went in
there the other day."</p>

<p class="indent">By the general term Threadneedle Street he meant
to indicate the offices of the Baron&#39;s London correspondents,
which were situate there.</p>

<p class="indent">"They keep you informed, it seems?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I live by being kept informed," said the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston was walking by him, accommodating his
pace to the old man&#39;s feeble walk.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean you came to see me?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, if you&#39;ll forgive the liberty&mdash;in part."</p>

<p class="indent">"And why did you want me?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I&#39;ve not lost all interest in Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, you haven&#39;t," said Ruston. "On the contrary,
you&#39;ve been increasing your interest."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron stopped and looked at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you know that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you can tell me whether I shall lose my
money," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you ever lose your money, Baron?"</p>

<p class="indent">"But am I to hear about Omofaga?" asked the
Baron, countering question by question.</p>

<p class="indent">"As much as you like," answered Ruston, with the
indifference of perfect candour.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, by the way, I have heard about it already.
Who are the ladies here who talk about it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston gave a careful catalogue of all the
persons in Dieppe who were interested in the Omofaga
Company. The Baron identified the Seminghams and
Adela. Then he observed,</p>

<p class="indent">"And the other lady is Mrs. Dennison, is she?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She is. I&#39;m going to her house to-morrow.
Shall I take you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I should be charmed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. To-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you&#39;ll dine with me to-night?"</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston was about to refuse; but the Baron added,
half seriously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve come a long way to see you."</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, I&#39;ll come," he said. Then he paused a
moment, and looked at the Baron curiously. "And
perhaps you&#39;ll tell me then," he added.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why I&#39;ve come?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; and why you&#39;ve been buying. You were
bought out. What do you want to come in again
for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll tell you all that now," said the Baron. "I&#39;ve
come because I thought I should like to see some more
of you; and I&#39;ve been buying because I fancy you&#39;ll
make a success of it."</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston pulled his beard thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t you believe me?" asked the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let&#39;s wait a bit," suggested Ruston. Then, with
a sudden twinkle of his eye, his holiday mood seemed
to come back again. Seizing the Baron&#39;s arm, he
pressed it, and said with a laugh, "I say, Baron, if
you want to get control over Omofaga&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"But, my dear friend&mdash;&mdash;" protested the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you do&mdash;I only say &#39;if&#39;&mdash;I&#39;m not the only
man you&#39;ve got to fight. Well, yes, I am the only
<i>man</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear young friend, I don&#39;t understand you,"
pleaded the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;ll go and see Mrs. Dennison to-morrow," said
Willie Ruston.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE THING OR THE MAN.</h3>

<p class="indent">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent">It was the morning of the next day, Mrs. Dennison
sat in her place in the little garden on the cliff,
and Willie Ruston stood just at the turn of the
mounting path, where Marjory had paused to look at
her friend.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, here I am," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not move, but held out her hand. He
advanced and took it.</p>

<p class="indent">"I met your children down below," he went on,
"but they would hardly speak to me. Why don&#39;t
they like me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind the children."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I do mind. Most children like me."</p>

<p class="indent">"How is everything?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In London? Oh, first-rate. I saw your husband
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean, how is Omofaga?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Capital; and here?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"It has been atrociously dull. What could you
expect?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I didn&#39;t expect that, or I shouldn&#39;t have
come."</p>

<p class="indent">"Are the stores started?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought it was holiday time? Well, yes, they
are."</p>

<p class="indent">She had been looking at him ever since he came,
and at last he noticed it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do I look well?" he asked in joke.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know, it&#39;s rather a pleasure to look at you,"
she replied. "I&#39;ve been feeling so shut in," and she
pushed her hair back from her forehead, and glanced
at him with a bright smile. "And it&#39;s really going
well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"So well," he nodded, "that everything&#39;s quiet,
and the preparations well ahead. In three months"
(and his enthusiasm began to get hold of him) "I
shall be off; in two more I hope to be actually there,
and then&mdash;why, forward!"</p>

<p class="indent">She had listened at first with sparkling eyes; as
he finished, her lips drooped, and she leant back in
her chair. There was a moment&#39;s silence; then she
said in a low voice,</p>

<p class="indent">"Three months!"</p>

<p class="indent">"It oughtn&#39;t to take more than two, if Jackson
has arranged things properly for me."</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently he was thinking of his march up country;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
but it was the first three mouths that were in
her mind. She had longed to see the thing really
started, hastened by all her efforts the hour that was
to set him at work, and dreamt of the day when he
should set foot in Omofaga. Now all this seemed
assured, imminent, almost present; yet there was no
exultation in her tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"I meant, before you started," she said slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up in surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t manage sooner," he said, defending himself.
"You know I don&#39;t waste time."</p>

<p class="indent">He was still off the scent; and even she herself
was only now, for the first time and as yet dimly,
realising her own mind.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have to do everything myself," he said. "Dear
old Carlin can&#39;t walk a step alone, and the Board"&mdash;he
paused, remembering that Harry Dennison was on
the Board&mdash;"well, I find it hard to make them move
as quick as I want. I had to fix a date, and I fixed
the earliest I could be absolutely sure of."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why don&#39;t they help you more?" she burst out
indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I don&#39;t want help."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, but I helped you!" she exclaimed, leaning
forward, full again of animation.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t deny it," he laughed. "You did indeed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said, and became again silent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Apropos</i>," said he. "I want to bring someone to
see you this afternoon&mdash;Baron von Geltschmidt."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He was the German capitalist, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"What! Why, what&#39;s he doing here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He came to see me&mdash;so he says. May I bring
him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, yes. He&#39;s a great&mdash;a great man, isn&#39;t he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he&#39;s a great financier."</p>

<p class="indent">"And he came to see you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"So he says."</p>

<p class="indent">"And don&#39;t you believe him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. I want your opinion," answered
Ruston, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you serious?" she asked quickly. "I mean,
do you really want my opinion, or are you being
polite?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t think <i>you</i> a fool, you know," said Willie
Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">She flashed a glance of understanding, mingled
with reproach, at him, and, leaning forward again,
said,</p>

<p class="indent">"Has he come about Omofaga?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That you might tell me too&mdash;or will you want
all Omofaga if you do so much?"</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment she smiled in recollection. Then
her face grew sad.</p>

<p class="indent">"Much of Omofaga I shall have!" she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I&#39;ll write," he promised carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Write!" she repeated in low, scornful tones.
"Would you like to be written to about it? It&#39;ll
happen to you, and I&#39;m to be written to!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, then, I won&#39;t write."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, do write."</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston smiled tolerantly, but his smile was
suddenly cut short, for Mrs. Dennison, not looking at
him but out to sea, asked herself in a whisper, which
was plainly not meant for him though he heard it,</p>

<p class="indent">"How shall I bear it?"</p>

<p class="indent">He had been tilting his chair back; he brought
the front legs suddenly on to the ground again and
asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"Bear what?"</p>

<p class="indent">She started to find he had heard, but attempted no
evasion.</p>

<p class="indent">"When you&#39;ve gone," she answered in simple directness.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her with raised eyebrows. There
was no embarrassment in her face, and no tremble in
her voice; and no passion could he detect in either.</p>

<p class="indent">"How flat it will all be," she added in a tone of
utter weariness.</p>

<p class="indent">He was half-pleased, half-piqued at the way she
seemed to look at him. It not only failed to satisfy
him, but stirred a new dissatisfaction. It hinted
much, but only, it seemed to him, to negative it. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
left Omofaga still all in all, and him of interest only
because he would talk of and work for Omofaga, and
keep the Omofaga atmosphere about her. Now this
was wrong, for Omofaga existed for him, not he for
Omofaga; that was the faith of true disciples.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t care about me," he said. "It&#39;s all
the Company&mdash;and only the Company because it
gives you something to do. Well, the Company&#39;ll go
on (I hope), and you&#39;ll hear about our doings."</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to him with a puzzled look.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know what it is," she said with a shake
of her head. Then, with a sudden air of understanding,
as though she had caught the meaning that before
eluded her, she cried, "I&#39;m just like you, I believe.
If I went to Omofaga, and you had to stay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, it would be the deuce!" he laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yes. Well, it is&mdash;the deuce," she answered,
laughing in return. But in a moment she was grave
again.</p>

<p class="indent">Her attraction for him&mdash;the old special attraction
of the unknown and unconquered&mdash;came strongly
upon him, and mingled more now with pleasure in
her. Her silence let him think; and he began to
think how wasted she was on Harry Dennison. Another
thought followed, and to that he gave utterance.</p>

<p class="indent">"But you&#39;ve lots of things you could do at home;
you could have plenty to work at, and plenty of&mdash;of
influence, and so on."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, but&mdash;oh, it would come to Mr. Belford!
Who wants to influence Mr. Belford? Besides, I&#39;ve
grown to love it now, haven&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Omofaga?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes! It&#39;s so far off&mdash;and most people don&#39;t believe
in it."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, confound them! I wish they did!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you? I&#39;m not sure I do."</p>

<p class="indent">She was so absorbed that she had not heard an
approaching step, and was surprised to see Ruston
jump up while her last sentence was but half said.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear Miss Valentine," he cried, his face lighting
up with a smile of pleasure, "how pleasant to
meet you again!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was no mistaking the sincerity of his greeting.
Marjory blushed as she gave him her hand, and
he fixed his eyes on her in undisguised approval.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re looking splendid," he said. "Is it the
air or the bathing or what?"</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps it was both in part, but, more than either,
it was a change that worked outwards from within,
and was giving to her face the expression without
which mere beauty of form or colour is poor in allurement.
The last traces of what Lord Semingham
meant by "insipidity" had been chased away. Ruston
felt the change though he could not track it.</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory, a bad dissembler, greeted him nervously,
almost coldly; she was afraid to let her gaze rest on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
him or on Mrs. Dennison for long, lest it should hint
her secret. Her manner betrayed such uneasiness
that Ruston noticed it. Mrs. Dennison did not, for
something in Ruston&#39;s face had caught her attention.
She had seen many expressions in his eyes as he
looked at her&mdash;of sympathy, amusement, pleasure,
even (what had pleased her most) puzzle, but never
what she saw now. The look now was a man&#39;s homage
to beauty&mdash;it differs from every other&mdash;a lover
hardly seems to have it unless his love be beautiful&mdash;and
she had never yet seen it when he looked at her.
She turned away towards the sea, grasping the arm of
her chair with a sudden grip that streaked her fingers
red and white. Marjory also saw, and a wild hope
leapt up in her that her task needed not the doing.
But a moment later Ruston was back in Omofaga&mdash;young
Sir Walter being his bridge for yet another
transit.</p>

<p class="indent">"How&#39;s Mr. Dennison?" asked Marjory, when he
gave her an opportunity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, he&#39;s all right. You&#39;d have heard, I suppose,
if he hadn&#39;t been?"</p>

<p class="indent">It was true. Marjory recognised the inappropriateness
of her question, but Mrs. Dennison came to
the rescue.</p>

<p class="indent">"Marjory wants a personal impression," she said.
"You know she and my husband are great allies!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," laughed Ruston, "he was a little cross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
with me because I would come to Dieppe. I should
have felt the same in his place; but he&#39;s well enough,
I think."</p>

<p class="indent">"I was going down to find Lady Semingham,"
said Marjory. "Are you coming down this morning,
Maggie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie" was something new&mdash;adopted at Mrs.
Dennison&#39;s request.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think not, dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"I am," said Ruston, taking up his walking stick.
"I shall be up with the Baron this afternoon, Mrs.
Dennison. Come along, Miss Valentine. We&#39;ve been
having no end of palaver about Omofaga," and as they
disappeared down the cliff Mrs. Dennison heard his
voice talking eagerly to Marjory.</p>

<p class="indent">She felt her heart beating quickly. She had to
conquer a strange impulse to rise and hurry after
them. She knew that she must be jealous&mdash;jealous,
she said to herself, trying to laugh, that he should talk
about Omofaga to other people. Nonsense! Why,
he was always talking of it! There was a stronger
feeling in her, less vague, of fuller force. It had come
on her when he spoke of his going to Africa, but then
it was hard to understand, for with all her heart she
thought she was still bent on his going. It spoke
more clearly now, stirred by the threat of opposition.
At first it had been the thing&mdash;the scheme&mdash;the idea&mdash;that
had caught her; she had taken the man for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
thing&#39;s sake, because to do such a thing proved him a
man after her pattern. But now, as she sat in the
little garden, she dimly traced her change&mdash;she loved
the scheme because it was his. She did not shrink
from testing it. "Yes," she murmured, "if he gave
it up now, I should go on with him to something else."
Then came another step&mdash;why should he not give it
up? Why should he go into banishment&mdash;he who
might go near to rule England? Why should he
empty her life by going? But if he went&mdash;and she
could not persuade herself that she had power to stop
his going&mdash;he must go from her side, it must be she
who gave him the stirrup-cup, she towards whom he
would look across the sea, she for whom he would
store up his brief, grim tales of victory, in whose eyes
he would see the reflection of his triumphs. Could
she fill such a place in his life? She knew that she
did not yet, but she believed in herself. "I feel large
enough," she said with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet there was something that she had not yet
touched in him&mdash;the thing which had put that look
in his eyes, a thing that for the moment at least Marjory
Valentine had touched. Why had she not? She
answered, with a strong clinging to self-approbation,
that it was because she would not. She told herself
that she had asked nothing from her intercourse with
him save the play of mind on mind&mdash;it was her mind
and nothing else that her own home failed to satisfy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
She recalled the scornful disgust with which she had
listened to Semingham when he hinted to her that
there was only one way to rule a man. It seemed less
disgusting to her now than when he spoke. For, in
the light of that look in his eyes, there stood revealed
a new possibility&mdash;always obvious, never hitherto
thought of&mdash;that another would take and wield the
lower mighty power that she had disdained to grasp,
and by the might of the lower wrest from her the higher.
Was not the lower solidly based in nature, the higher
a fanciful structure resting in no sound foundation?
The moment this spectre took form before her&mdash;the
moment she grasped that the question might lie between
her and another&mdash;that it might be not what she
would take but what she could keep&mdash;her heart cried
out, to ears that shrank from the tumultuous reckless
cry, that less than all was nothing, that, if need be, all
must be paid for all. And, swift on the horror of her
discovery, came the inevitable joy in it&mdash;joy that will
be silenced by no reproofs, not altogether abashed by
any shame, that no pangs can rob utterly of its existence&mdash;a
thing to smother, to hide, to rejoice in.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet she would not face unflinchingly what her
changing mind must mean. She tried to put it aside&mdash;to
think of something, ah! of anything else, of anything
that would give her foothold.</p>

<p class="indent">"I love my husband," she found herself saying.
"I love poor old Harry and the children." She repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
it again and again, praying the shibboleth to
show its saving virtue. It was part of her creed, part
of her life, to be a good wife and mother&mdash;part of her
traditions that women who were not that were nothing
at all, and that there was nothing a woman might
take in exchange for this one splendid, all-comprehending
virtue. To that she must stand&mdash;it was
strange to be driven to argue with herself on such a
point. She mused restlessly as she sat; she listened
eagerly for her children&#39;s footsteps mounting the hill;
she prayed an interruption to rescue her from her
thoughts. Just now she would think no more about
it; it was thinking about it that did all the harm.
Yet while she was alone she could not choose but surrender
to the thought of it&mdash;to the thought of what a
price she must pay for her traditions and her creed.
The payment, she cried, would leave life an empty
thing. Yet it must be paid&mdash;if it must. Was it now
come to that? Was this the parting of the roads?</p>

<p class="indent">"I must, yet I cannot! I must not, yet I must."
It was the old clash of powers, the old conflict of commands,
the old ruthless will of nature that makes right
too hard and yet fastens anguish upon sin&mdash;that makes
us yearn for and hate the higher while we love and
loathe the lower.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>THE WORK OF A WEEK.</h3>

<p class="indent">Much went to spoil the stay at Dieppe, but the
only overt trouble was the feeble health of the Baron
von Geltschmidt. The old man had rapidly made his
way into the liking of his new acquaintances. Semingham
found his dry, worldly-wise, perhaps world-weary,
humour an admirable sauce to conversation;
Adela Ferrars detected kindness in him; his gallant
deference pleased Lady Semingham. They were all
grieved when the cold winds laid hold of him, forced
him to keep house often, and drove him to furs and
a bath-chair, even when the sun shone most brightly.
Although they liked him, they implored him to fly
south. He would not move, finding pleasure in them,
and held fast by an ever-increasing uneasy interest in
Willie Ruston. Adela quarrelled with him heartily
and energetically on this score. To risk health because
anyone was interesting was absurd; to risk it
on Ruston&#39;s account most preposterous. "I&#39;d be ill to
get away from him," she declared. The Baron was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
obstinate, fatalistic as to his health, infatuated in his
folly; stay he would, while Ruston stayed. Yet what
Ruston did, pleased him not; for the better part of
the man&mdash;what led him to respond to kindness or
affection, and abate something of his hardness where
he met no resistance&mdash;seemed to be conspiring with
his old domineering mood to lead him beyond all
power of warning or recall.</p>

<p class="indent">A week had passed since Ruston paid his first visit
to Mrs. Dennison in the cottage on the cliff. It was a
bright morning. The Baron was feeling stronger; he
had left his chair and walked with Adela to a seat.
There they sat side by side, in the occasional talk and
easy silences of established friendship. The Baron
smoked his cigar; Adela looked idly at the sea; but
suddenly the Baron began to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">"I had a talk with our friend, Lord Semingham,
this morning," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"About anything in particular?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I meant it to be, but he doesn&#39;t like talk that
leads anywhere in particular."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, he doesn&#39;t," said Adela, with a slight smile.</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron sat silent for a moment, then he
said,</p>

<p class="indent">"May I talk to you, Miss Ferrars?" and he looked
at her inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, of course," she answered. "Is it about
yourself, Baron? You&#39;re not worse, are you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span></p>

<p class="indent">He took no notice of her question, but pointed
towards the cliff.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is happening up there?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela started. She had not realised that he meant
to talk on that subject.</p>

<p class="indent">He detected her shrinking and hastened to defend
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">"Or are we to say nothing?" he asked. "Nothing?
When we all see! Don&#39;t you see? Doesn&#39;t
Miss Valentine see? Is she so sad for nothing? Oh,
don&#39;t shake your head. And the other&mdash;this Mrs.
Dennison? Am I to go on?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," said Adela sharply; and added, a moment
later, "I know."</p>

<p class="indent">"And what does he mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He?" cried Adela. "Oh, he&#39;s not human."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nay, but he&#39;s terribly human," said the old
Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela looked round at him, but then turned
away.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know what I would say, but I may not say it,"
pursued the Baron. "To you I may not say it. I
know him. He will take, if he is offered."</p>

<p class="indent">His voice sank to a whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then God help her," murmured Adela under her
breath, while her cheeks flamed red.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, he will take, and he will go. Ah, he is a
man to follow and to believe in&mdash;to trust your money,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
your fortune, your plans, even your secrets to;
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He paused, flinging away his extinct cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" asked Adela in a low tone, eager in spite
of her hatred of the topic.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never your love," said he; and added, "yet I
believe I, who am old enough to know better, and too
old to learn better, have almost given him mine.
Well, I am not a woman."</p>

<p class="indent">"He can&#39;t hurt you," said Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, he can," said the Baron with a dreary smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela was not thinking of her companion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why do you talk of it?" she asked impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know I was wrong."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no. I mean, why do you talk of it now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because," said the Baron, "he will not. Have
you seen no change in him this week? A week ago,
he laughed when I talked to him. He did not mind
me speaking&mdash;it was still a trifle&mdash;nonsense&mdash;a week
ago; if you like, an amusement, a pastime!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, and now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Now he tells me to hold my tongue. And yet I
am glad for one thing. That girl will not have him
for a husband."</p>

<p class="indent">"Glad! Why, Baron, don&#39;t you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I see. Still I am glad."</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t go on talking about it; but is there no
hope?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Where is it? For the time&mdash;mind you for the
time&mdash;he is under that other woman&#39;s power."</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s under his, you mean."</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean both. She was a friend of yours. Yes.
She is not altogether a bad woman; but she has had a
bad fortune. Ah, there she is, and he with her."</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke, Mrs. Dennison and Ruston came by.
Mrs. Dennison flung them a glance of recognition; it
was hardly more, and even for so much she seemed to
grudge the interruption. Ruston&#39;s greeting was more
ceremonious; he smiled, but his brows contracted a
little, and he said to his companion,</p>

<p class="indent">"Miss Ferrars isn&#39;t pleased with me."</p>

<p class="indent">"That hurts?" she asked lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," he answered, after a short pause, "I don&#39;t
know that it does."</p>

<p class="indent">But the frown dwelt a little longer on his face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sit down here," she said, and they sat down in
full view of Adela and the Baron, about twenty yards
off.</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s mad," murmured Adela, and the Baron
muttered assent.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the time of the morning when everybody
was out. Presently Lord and Lady Semingham
strolled by&mdash;Lady Semingham did not see Maggie
Dennison, her husband did, and Adela caught the
look in his eye. Then down from the hill and on to
the grass came Marjory Valentine. She saw both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
couples, and, for a perceptible moment, stood wavering
between them. She looked pale and weary. Mrs.
Dennison indicated her with the slightest gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">"You were asking for her. There she is," she
said to Willie Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I think I&#39;ll go and ask her."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To come for a walk."</p>

<p class="indent">"Now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not?" he asked with a surprised smile.</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke, Marjory&#39;s hesitation ended; she joined
Adela and the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">"How rude you are!" exclaimed Mrs. Dennison
angrily, "you asked me to come out with you."</p>

<p class="indent">"So I did. By Jove, so I did! But you don&#39;t
walk, do you? And I feel rather like a walk now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, if you prefer her society&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Her prattle," he said, smiling, "amuses me.
You and I always discuss high matters, you see."</p>

<p class="indent">"She doesn&#39;t prattle, and you know it."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her for a moment. He had gone so
far as to rise, but he resumed his seat.</p>

<p class="indent">"What&#39;s the matter?" he asked tolerantly.</p>

<p class="indent">Maggie Dennison&#39;s lip quivered. The week that
had passed had been a stormy one to her. There had
been a breaking-down of barriers&mdash;barriers of honour,
conscience, and pride. All she could do to gain or
keep her mastery she had done. She had all but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
thrown herself at his feet. She hated to think of the
things she had said or half-said; and she had seen
Marjory&#39;s eyes look wondering horror and pitying contempt
at her. Of her husband she would not think.
And she had won in return&mdash;she knew not what. It
hung still in the balance. Sometimes he would seem
engrossed in her; but again he would turn to Marjory
or another with a kind of relief, as though she wearied
him. And of her struggles, of the great humiliations
she suffered, of all she sacrificed to him, he seemed
unconscious. Yet, cost what it might, she could not
let him go now. The screen of Omofaga was dropped;
she knew that it was the man whose life she was resolute
to fill; whether she called it love for him or what
else mattered little; it seemed rather a mere condition
of existence, necessary yet not sweet, even revolting;
but its alternative was death.</p>

<p class="indent">She had closed her eyes for a moment under the
stress of her pain. When she opened them, he was
looking at her. And the look she knew was at last in
his eyes. She put up her hand to ward it off; it woke
her horror, but it woke her delight also. She could
not choose whether to banish it, or to live in it all
her life. She tried to speak, but her utterance was
choked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, I believe you&#39;re&mdash;jealous," said Willie Ruston.
"But then they always say I&#39;m a conceited
chap."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span></p>

<p class="indent">He spoke with a laugh, but he looked at her intently.
The little scene was the climax of a week&#39;s
gradual betrayal. Often in all the hours they had
spent together, in all the engrossing talks they had
had, something of the kind had appeared and disappeared;
he had wondered at her changefulness, her
moods of expansion and of coldness&mdash;a rapturous
greeting of him to be followed by a cold dismissal&mdash;an
eager sympathy alternating with wilful indifference.
She had, too, fits of prudence, when she would not go
with him&mdash;and then spasms of recklessness when her
manner seemed to defy all restraint and mock at the
disapproval of her friends. On these puzzles&mdash;to him,
preoccupied as he was and little versed in such matters,
they had seemed such&mdash;the present moment shed
its light. He recalled, with understanding, things
that had passed meaninglessly before his eyes, that he
seemed to have forgotten altogether; the ambiguous
things became plain; what had been, though plain,
yet strange, fell into its ordered place and became
natural. The new relation between them proclaimed
itself the interpretation and the work of the bygone
week.</p>

<p class="indent">Her glove lay in her lap, and he touched it lightly;
the gesture speaking of their sudden new familiarity.</p>

<p class="indent">Her reproach was no less eloquent; she rebuked
not the thing, but the rashness of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t do that. They&#39;re looking," she found voice
to whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">He withdrew his hand, and, taking off his hat,
pushed the hair back from his forehead. Presently
he looked at her with an almost comical air of perplexity;
she was conscious of the glance, but she would
not meet it. He pursed his lips to whistle.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t," she whispered sharply. "Don&#39;t whistle."
A whistle brought her husband to her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">The checked whistle rudely reflected his mingled
feelings. He wished that he had been more on his
guard&mdash;against her and against himself. There had
been enough to put him on his guard; if he had been
put on his guard, this thing need not have happened.
He called the thing in his thoughts "inconvenient."
He was marvellously awake to the inconvenience of it;
it was that which came uppermost in his mind as he
sat by Maggie Dennison. Yet, in spite of a phrase
that sounded so cold and brutal, his reflections paid
her no little compliment; for he called the revelation
inconvenient all the more, and most of all, because he
found it of immense interest, because it satisfied suddenly
and to the full a sense of interest and expectation
that had been upon him, because it seemed to
make an immense change in his mind and to alter the
conditions of his life. Had it not done all this, its
inconvenience would have been much less&mdash;to him
and save in so far as he grieved for her&mdash;nay, it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
have been, in reality, nothing. It was inconvenient
because it twisted his purposes, set him at jar with
himself, and cut across the orderly lines he had laid
down&mdash;and because, though it did all this, he was
not grieved nor angry at it.</p>

<p class="indent">He rose to his feet. Mrs. Dennison looked up
quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall go for my walk now," he said, and he
added in answer to her silent question, "Oh, yes,
alone. I&#39;ve got a thing or two I want to think about."</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes dropped as he spoke. He had smiled,
and she, in spite of herself, had smiled in answer; but
she could not look at him while she smiled. He
stood there for an instant, smiling still; then he grew
grave, and turned to walk away. Her sigh witnessed
the relaxation of the strain. But, after one step, he
faced her again, and said, as though the idea had just
struck him,</p>

<p class="indent">"I say, when does Dennison come?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In a week," she answered.</p>

<p class="indent">For just a moment again, he stood still, thoughtfully
looking at her. Then he lifted his hat, wheeled
round, and walked briskly off towards the jetty at the
far end of the expanse of grass. Adela Ferrars, twenty
yards off, marked his going with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison sat where she was a little while
longer. Her agitation was quickly passing, and there
followed on it a feeling of calm. She seemed to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
resigned charge of herself, to have given her conduct
into another&#39;s keeping. She did not know what he
would do; he had uttered no word of pleasure or
pain, praise or blame; and that question at the last&mdash;about
her husband&mdash;was ambiguous. Did he ask it,
fearing Harry&#39;s arrival, or did he think the arrival of
her husband would end an awkward position and set
him free? Really, she did not know. She had done
what she could&mdash;and what she could not help. He
must do what he liked&mdash;only, knowing him, she did
not think that she had set an end to their acquaintance.
And that for the moment was enough.</p>

<p class="indent">"A woman, Bessie," she heard a voice behind her
saying, "may be anything from a cosmic force to a
clothes-peg."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know what a cosmic force is," said Lady
Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"A cosmic force? Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"But I don&#39;t want to know, Alfred. Why, Maggie,
that&#39;s a new shade of brown on your shoes.
Where do you get them?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison gave her bootmaker&#39;s address, and
Lady Semingham told her husband to remember it.
She never remembered that he always forgot such
things.</p>

<p class="indent">The arrival of the Seminghams seemed to break
the spell which had held Mrs. Dennison apart from
the group over against her. Adela strolled across,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
followed by Marjory, and the Baron on Marjory&#39;s
arm. The whole party gathered in a cluster; but
Marjory hung loosely on the outskirts of the circle,
and seemed scarcely to belong to it.</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron seated himself in the place Willie Ruston
had left empty. The rest stood talking for a
minute or two, then Semingham put his hand in his
pocket and drew out a folded sheet of tracing-paper.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;re all Omofagites here, aren&#39;t we?" he said;
"even you, Baron, now. Here&#39;s a plan Carlin has
just sent me. It shows our territory."</p>

<p class="indent">Everybody crowded round to look as he unfolded
it. Mrs. Dennison was first in undisguised eagerness;
and Marjory came closer, slipping her arm through
Adela Ferrars&#39;.</p>

<p class="indent">"What does the blue mean?" asked Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Native settlements."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! And all that brown?&mdash;it&#39;s mostly brown."</p>

<p class="indent">"Brown," answered Semingham, with a slight
smile, "means unexplored country."</p>

<p class="indent">"I should have made it all brown," said Adela,
and the Baron gave an appreciative chuckle.</p>

<p class="indent">"And what are these little red crosses?" asked
Mrs. Dennison, laying the tip of her finger on one.</p>

<p class="indent">"Eh? What, those? Oh, let me see. Here,
just hold it while I look at Carlin&#39;s letter. He explains
it all," and Lord Semingham began to fumble
in his breast-pocket.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Dear me," said Bessie Semingham, in a tone of
delicate pleasure, "they look like tombstones."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush, hush, my dear lady," cried the old Baron;
"what a bad omen!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Tombstones," echoed Maggie Dennison thoughtfully.
"So they do&mdash;just like tombstones."</p>

<p class="indent">A pause fell on the group. Adela broke it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Director, have you found your directions?"
she asked briskly.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was a momentary lapse of memory," said Semingham
with dignity. "Those&mdash;er&mdash;little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, not tombstones," interrupted the Baron earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Little&mdash;er&mdash;signposts are, of course, the forts
belonging to the Company. What else should they
be?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, <i>forts</i>," murmured everybody.</p>

<p class="indent">"They are," continued Lord Semingham apologetically,
"in the nature of a prophecy at present, as
I understand."</p>

<p class="indent">"A very bad prophecy, according to Bessie," said
Mrs. Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope," said the Baron, shaking his head, "that
the official name is more correct than Lady Semingham&#39;s."</p>

<p class="indent">"So do I," said Marjory; and added, before she
could think not to add, and with unlucky haste, "my
brother&#39;s going out, you know."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison looked at her. Then she crossed
over to her, saying to Adela,</p>

<p class="indent">"You never let me have a word with my own
guest, except at breakfast and bedtime. Come and
walk up and down with me, Marjory."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory obeyed; the group began to scatter.</p>

<p class="indent">"But didn&#39;t they look like tombstones, Baron?"
said Bessie Semingham again, as she sat down and
made room for the old man beside her. When she
had an idea she liked it very much. He began to be
voluble in his reproof of her gloomy fancies; but she
merely laughed in glee at her ingenuity.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela, by a gesture, brought Semingham to her
side and walked a few paces off with him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you go with me to the post-office?" she said
abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">"By all means," he answered, feeling for his glass.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you needn&#39;t get your glass to spy at me
with."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear, dear, you use one yourself!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll tell you myself why I&#39;m going. You&#39;re going
to send a telegram."</p>

<p class="indent">"Am I?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; to invite someone to stay with you. Lord
Semingham, when you find a woman relies on a man&mdash;on
one man only&mdash;in trouble, what do you think?"</p>

<p class="indent">She asked the question in a level voice, looking
straight before her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"That she&#39;s fond of him."</p>

<p class="indent">"And does he&mdash;the man&mdash;think the same?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Generally. I think most men would. They&#39;re
seldom backward to think it, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then," she said steadily, "you must think, and
he must think, what you like. I can&#39;t help it. I
want you to wire and ask a man to come and stay
with you."</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to her in surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom Loring," she said, and the moment the
name left her lips Semingham hastily turned his
glance away.</p>

<p class="indent">"Awkward&mdash;with the other fellow here," he ventured
to suggest.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Ruston doesn&#39;t choose your guests."</p>

<p class="indent">"But Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, fancy talking of awkwardness now! He
used to influence her once, you know. Perhaps he
might still. Do let us try," and her voice trembled
in earnestness.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;ll try. Will he come? He&#39;s very angry
with her."</p>

<p class="indent">And Adela answered, still looking straight in front
of her,</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m going to send him a wire, too."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m very glad to hear it," said Lord Semingham.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE LAST BARRIERS.</h3>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston rested his elbows on the jetty-wall
and gazed across the harbour entrance. He had
come there to think; and deliberate thinking was a
rare thing for him to set his head to. His brain dealt
generally&mdash;even with great matters, as all brains deal
with small&mdash;in rapid half-unconscious beats; the process
coalescing so closely with the decision as to be
merged before it could be recognised. But about
this matter he meant to think; and the first result of
his determination was (as it often is in such a case)
that nothing at all relevant would stay by him.
There was a man fishing near, and he watched the
float; he looked long at the big hotel at Puys, which
faced him a mile away, and idly wondered whether it
were full; he followed the egress of a fishing boat
with strict attention. Then, in impatience, he turned
round and sat down on the stone bench and let his
eyes see nothing but the flags of the pavement. Even
then he hardly thought; but after a time he became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
vaguely occupied with Maggie Dennison, his mind
playing to and fro over her voice, her tricks of manner,
her very gait, and at last settling more or less
resolutely on the strange revelation of herself which
she had gradually made and had consummated that
day. It changed his feelings towards her; but
it did not change them to contempt. He had his
ideas, but he did not make ideal figures out of humanity;
and humanity could go very far wrong and sink
very deep in its lower possibilities without shocking
him. Nor did he understand her, nor realise how
great a struggle had brought what he saw to birth.
It seemed to him a thing not unnatural, even in her,
who was in much unlike most other women. There
are dominions that are not to be resisted, and we do
not think people weak simply because they are under
our own influence. His surprise was reserved for the
counter-influence which he felt, and strove not to acknowledge;
his contempt for the disturbance into
which he himself was thrown. At that he was half-displeased,
puzzled, and alarmed; yet that, too, had
its delight.</p>

<p class="indent">"What rot it is!" he muttered, in the rude dialect
of self-communion, which sums up a bewildering conflict
in a word of slang.</p>

<p class="indent">He was afraid of himself&mdash;and his exclamation betrayed
the fear. Men of strong will are not all will;
the strong will has other strong things to fight, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
the strong head has mighty rebels to hold down.
That he felt; but his fear of himself had its limits.
He was not the man&mdash;as he saw very well at this moment,
and recognised with an odd mixture of pride
and humiliation&mdash;to give up his life to a passion.
Had that been the issue clearly and definitely set before
him he would not have sat doubtful on the jetty.
He understood what of nobility lay in such a temperament,
and his humiliation was because it made no
part of him; but the pride overmastered, and at last
he was glad to say to himself that there was no danger
of his losing all for love. Indeed, was he in love? In
love in the grand sense people talked and wrote about
so much? Well, there were other senses, and there
were many degrees. The question he weighed, or
rather the struggle which he was undergoing, was between
resisting or yielding before a temptation to take
into his life something which should not absorb it, but
yet in a measure alter it, which allured him all the
more enticingly because, judging as he best could, he
could see no price which must be paid for it&mdash;well,
except one. And, as the one came into his mind, it
made him pause, and he mused on it, looking at it in
all lights. Sometimes he put the price as an act of
wrong which would stain him&mdash;for, apart from other,
maybe greater, maybe more fanciful obstacles, Harry
Dennison held him for a friend&mdash;sometimes as an act
of weakness which would leave him vulnerable. And,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
after these attempted reasonings, he would fall again
to thinking of Maggie Dennison, her voice, her manner,
and the revelation of herself; and in these picturings
the reasoning died away.</p>

<p class="indent">There are a few deliberate sinners, a few by whom
"Evil, be thou my Good" is calmly uttered as a dedication
and a sacrament, but most men do not make
up their minds to be sinners or determine in cool resolve
to do acts of the sort that lurked behind Willie
Ruston&#39;s picturings. They only fail to make up their
minds not to do them. Ruston, in a fury of impatience,
swept all his musings from him&mdash;it led to
nothing. It left him where he was. He was vexing
himself needlessly; he told himself that he could not
decide what he ought to do. In truth, he did not
choose to decide what it was that he chose to do.
And with the thoughts that he drove away went the
depression they had carried with them. He was confident
again in himself, his destiny, his career; and in
its fancied greatness, the turmoil he had suffered sank
to its small proportions. He returned to his old standpoint,
and to the old medley of pride and shame it
gave him; he might be of supreme importance to
Maggie Dennison, but she was only of some importance
to him. He could live without her. But, at
present, he regarded her loss as a thing not necessary
to undergo.</p>

<p class="indent">It was late in the day that he met young Sir Walter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
who ran to him, open-mouthed with news. Walter
was afraid that the news would be unpalatable, and
could not understand such want of tact in Semingham.
To ask Tom Loring while Ruston was there
argued a bluntness of perception strange to young
Sir Walter. But, be the news good or bad, he had
only to report; and report it he did straightway to
his chief. Willie Ruston smiled, and said that, if
Loring did not mind meeting him, he did not mind
meeting Loring; indeed, he would welcome the opportunity
of proving to that unbeliever that there
was water somewhere within a hundred miles of
Fort Imperial (which Tom in one of those articles
had sturdily denied). Then he flirted away a
stone with his stick and asked if anyone had yet
told Mrs. Dennison. And, Sir Walter thinking not,
he said,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well, I&#39;m going there. I&#39;ll tell her."</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;ll know why he&#39;s coming," said Walter, nodding
his head wisely.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will she? Do you know?" asked Ruston with
a smile&mdash;young Sir Walter&#39;s wisdom was always sure
of that tribute from him.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you&#39;d seen Adela Ferrars, you&#39;d know too.
She tries to make believe it&#39;s nothing, but she&#39;s&mdash;oh,
she&#39;s&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s all of a flutter," laughed Walter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ve got to the bottom of that," said Ruston
in a tone of conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">"Still, I think it&#39;s inconsiderate of Loring; he
must know that Mrs. Dennison will find it rather
awkward. But, of course, if a fellow&#39;s in love, he
won&#39;t think of that."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose not," said Willie Ruston, smiling again
at this fine scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, with a sudden impulse, struck perhaps with
an envy of what he laughed at, he put his arm
through his young friend&#39;s, and exclaimed, with a
friendly confidential pressure of the hand,</p>

<p class="indent">"I say, Val, I wish the devil we were in Omofaga,
don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather!" came full and rich from his companion&#39;s
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"With a few thousand miles between us and everything&mdash;and
everybody!"</p>

<p class="indent">Young Sir Walter&#39;s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Off in three months now," he reminded his
leader exultingly.</p>

<p class="indent">It could not be. The Fates will not help in such
a fashion, it is not their business to cut the noose a
man ties round his neck&mdash;happy is he if they do not
draw it tight. With a sigh, Willie Ruston dropped
his companion&#39;s arm, and left him with no other farewell
than a careless nod. Of Tom Loring&#39;s coming
he thought little. It might be that Sir Walter had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
seen most of its meaning, and that Semingham was
acting as a benevolent match-maker&mdash;a character
strange for him, and amusing to see played&mdash;but, no
doubt, there was a little more. Probably Tom had
some idea of turning him from his path, of combating
his influence, of disputing his power. Well, Tom had
tried that once, and had failed; he would fail again.
Maggie Dennison had not hesitated to resent such
interference; she had at once (Ruston expressed it to
himself) put Tom in his right place. Tom would be
no more to her at Dieppe than in London&mdash;nay, he
would be less, for any power unbroken friendship and
habit might have had then would be gone by now.
Thus, though he saw the other meaning, he made light
of it, and it was as a bit of gossip concerning Adela
Ferrars, not as tidings which might affect herself, that
he told Mrs. Dennison of Tom&#39;s impending arrival.</p>

<p class="indent">On her the announcement had a very different
effect. For her the whole significance lay in what
Ruston ignored, and none in what had caught his
fancy. He was amazed to see the rush of colour to
her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom Loring coming here!" she cried in something
like horror.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, and with a laugh, Ruston pointed out the
motive of his coming, as young Sir Walter had interpreted
it; but he added, as though in concession, and
with another laugh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps he wants to keep his eye on me, too.
He doesn&#39;t trust me further than he can see me, you
know."</p>

<p class="indent">Without looking at him or seeming to listen to his
words, she asked, in low, indignant tones,</p>

<p class="indent">"How dare he come?"</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston opened his eyes. He did not understand
so much emotion spent on such a trifle. Say it
was bad taste in Loring to come, or an impertinence!
Well, it was not a tragedy at all events. He was
almost angry with her for giving importance to it;
and the importance she gave set him wondering.
But before he could translate his feeling into words,
she turned to him, leaning across the table that stood
between them, and clasping her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t bear to have him here now," she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">"What harm will he do? You needn&#39;t see anything
of him," rejoined Ruston, more astonished at
each new proof of disquietude in her.</p>

<p class="indent">But Tom Loring was not to be so lightly dismissed
from her mind; and she did not seem to heed
when Ruston added, with a laugh,</p>

<p class="indent">"You got rid of him once, didn&#39;t you? I should
think you could again."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, then! That was different."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her curiously. She was agitated,
but there seemed to be more than agitation. As he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
read it, it was fear; and discerning it, he spoke in
growing surprise and rising irritation.</p>

<p class="indent">"You look as if you were afraid of him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Afraid of him?" she broke out. "Yes, I am
afraid of him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of Loring?" he exclaimed in sheer wonder.
"Why, in heaven&#39;s name? Loring&#39;s not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He was going to say "your husband," but stopped
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t face him," she whispered. "Oh, you
know! Why do you torment me? Or don&#39;t you
know? Oh, how strange you are!"</p>

<p class="indent">And now there was fear in her eyes when she
looked at Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat still a moment, and then in slow tones he said,</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t see what concern your affairs are of Loring&#39;s,
or mine either, by God!"</p>

<p class="indent">At the last word his voice rose a little, and his lips
shut tight as it left them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, it&#39;s easy for you," she said, half in anger at
him, half in scorn of herself. "You don&#39;t know what
he is&mdash;what he was&mdash;to me."</p>

<p class="indent">"What was Loring to you?" he asked in sharp,
imperious tones&mdash;tones that made her hurriedly cry,</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no; not that, not that. How could you
think that of me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What then?" came curt and crisp from him, her
reproach falling unheeded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I wish&mdash;I wish you could understand just a
little! Do you think it&#39;s all nothing to me? Do you
think I don&#39;t mind?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know what it is to you," he said doggedly.
"I know it&#39;s nothing to Loring."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t believe," she went on, "that he&#39;s coming
because of Adela at all."</p>

<p class="indent">And as she spoke, she met his eyes for a moment,
and then shrank from them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, shall we speak plainly?" he asked with
evident impatience.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, you will, I know," she wailed, with a smile
and a despairing gesture. She loved and dreaded
him for it. "Not too plainly, Willie!"</p>

<p class="indent">His mouth relaxed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why do you worry about the fellow?" he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;ll speak plainly, too," she cried. "He&#39;s
not a fool; and he&#39;s an honest man. That&#39;s why I
don&#39;t want him here;" and enduring only till she
had flung out the truth, she buried her face in her
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve had enough of him," said Willie Ruston,
frowning. "He&#39;s always got in my way; first about
the Company&mdash;and now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He broke off, pushing his chair back, and rising to
his feet. He walked to the window of the little sitting-room
where they were; the sun was setting over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
the sea, and early dusk gathering. It was still, save
for the sound of the waves.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is there nobody at home?" he asked, with his
back towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">"No. Marjory and the children have gone down
to the <i>Rome</i> to have tea with Bessie Semingham."</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a moment longer, looking out, then he
came back and stood facing her. She was leaning
her head on her hand. At last she spoke in a low
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s Harry&#39;s friend," she said, "and he used to
be mine; and he trusted me."</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston threw his head back with a little
sharp jerk.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well, I didn&#39;t come to talk about Tom Loring,"
he said. "If you value his opinion so very
much, why, you must keep it; that&#39;s all," and he
moved towards where his hat was lying. "But I&#39;m
afraid I can&#39;t share my friends with him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I know you won&#39;t share anything with anybody,"
said Maggie Dennison, her voice trembling
between a sob and a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned instantly. His face lighted up, and the
sun, casting its last rays on her eyes, made them
answer with borrowed brilliance.</p>

<p class="indent">"I won&#39;t share you with Loring, anyhow," he
cried, walking close up to her, and resting his hand
on the table.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span></p>

<p class="indent">She laid hers gently on it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t go to Omofaga, Willie," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment he sheerly stared at her; then he
burst into a merry unrestrained peal of laughter.
Next he lifted her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are the most wonderful woman in the
world," said he, his mouth quivering with amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" she exclaimed, throwing her arms wide
for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what&#39;s the matter? What have I done
wrong now?"</p>

<p class="indent">She rose and walked up and down the room.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish I&#39;d never seen you," she said from the
far end of it.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish I&#39;d never seen&mdash;Tom Loring."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, that&#39;s the only thing!" she cried. "I may
live or I may die, or I may&mdash;do anything you like;
but I mustn&#39;t have another friend! I mustn&#39;t give a
thought to what anybody else thinks of me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You mustn&#39;t balance me against Tom Loring,"
he answered between his teeth, all signs of his merriment
gone now.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment&mdash;not long, but seeming very long&mdash;there
was silence in the room; and, while the brief
stillness reigned, she fought a last battle against him,
calling loyalty and friendship to her aid, praying their
alliance against the overbearing demand he made on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
her&mdash;against his roughness, his blindness to all she
suffered for him. But the strife was short. Lifting
her hands above her head, and bringing them down
through the air as with a blow, she cried,</p>

<p class="indent">"My God, I balance nothing against you!"</p>

<p class="indent">Her reward&mdash;her only reward&mdash;seemed on the
instant to be hers. Willie Ruston was transformed;
his sullenness was gone; his eyes were alight with
triumph; the smile she loved was on his lips, and
he had forgotten those troubled, useless, mazy musings
on the jetty. He took a quick step towards
her, holding out both his hands. She clasped
them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing?" he asked in a low tone. "Nothing,
Maggie?"</p>

<p class="indent">She bowed her head for answer; it was the attitude
of surrender, of helplessness, and of trust, and it appealed
to the softer feeling in him which her resistance
had smothered. He was strongly moved, and his face
was pale as he drew her to him and kissed her lips;
but all he said was,</p>

<p class="indent">"Then the deuce take Tom Loring!"</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to her enough. The light devil-may-care
words surely covered a pledge from him to her&mdash;something
in return from him to her. At last, surely
he was hers, and her wishes his law. It was her moment;
she would ask of him now the uttermost wish
of her heart&mdash;the wish that had displaced all else&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
passionate wish not to lose him&mdash;not, as it were,
to be emptied of him.</p>

<p class="indent">"And Omofaga?" she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes looked past her, out into the dim twilight,
into the broad world&mdash;the world that she seemed to
ask him to give for her, as she was giving her world
for him. He laughed again, but not as he had laughed
before. There was a note of wonder in his laugh now&mdash;of
wonder that the prayer seemed now not so utterly
absurd&mdash;that he could imagine himself doing even
that&mdash;spoiling his heart of its darling ambition&mdash;for
her. Yet, even in that moment of her strongest sway,
as her arms were about him, he was swearing to himself
that he would not.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not press for an answer. A glance into
his distant eyes gave her one, perhaps, for she sighed
as though in pain. Hearing her, he bent his look
on her again. Though he might deny that last
boon, he had given her much. So she read; and,
drawing herself to her full height, she released one
of her hands from his, and held it out to him. For
a moment he hesitated; then a slow smile breaking
on his face, he bent and kissed it, and she whispered
over his bent head, half in triumph, half in apology
for bidding him bend his head even in love,</p>

<p class="indent">"I like pretending to be queen&mdash;even with you,
Willie."</p>

<p class="indent">Her flattery, so sweet to him, because it was wrung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
from her all against her will, and was for him alone
of men, thrilled through him and he was drawing her
to him again when the merry chatter of a child struck
on their ears from the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">She shrank back.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hark!" she murmured. "They&#39;re coming."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said, with a frown. "I shall come to-morrow,
Maggie."</p>

<p class="indent">"To-morrow? Every day?" said she.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, then, every day. But to-morrow all day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, yes, all day to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent">"But I must go now."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no, don&#39;t go," she said quickly. "Sit down;
see, sit there. Don&#39;t look as if you&#39;d thought of going."</p>

<p class="indent">He did as she bade him, trying to assume an indifferent
air.</p>

<p class="indent">She, too, sat down, her eyes fixed on the door. A
strange look of pain and shame spread over her face.
She must bend to deceive her children, to dread detection,
to play little tricks and weave little devices
against the eyes of those for whom she had been an
earthly providence&mdash;the highest, most powerful, and
best they knew. Willie Ruston did not follow the
thought that stamped its mark on her face then, nor
understand why, with a sudden gasp, she dashed her
hand across her eyes and turned to him with trembling
lips, crying, in low tones,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, but I have you, Willie!"</p>

<p class="indent">Before he could answer her appeal, the voices were
in the passage. Her face grew calm, save for a slight
frown on her brow. She shaped her lips into a smile
to meet the incomers. She shot a rapid glance of
caution and warning at him. The door was flung
open, and the three children rushed in, Madge at
their head. Madge, seeing Willie Ruston, stopped
short, and her laughter died away. She turned and
said,</p>

<p class="indent">"Marjory, here&#39;s Mr. Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">None could mistake her tone for one of welcome.</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory Valentine came forward. She looked at
neither of them, but sat down near the table.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Madge," said Mrs. Dennison, "there&#39;s good
news for you, isn&#39;t there? Your friend&#39;s coming."</p>

<p class="indent">Madge, finding (as she thought) sympathy, came
to her mother&#39;s knee.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I&#39;m glad," she said. "Are you glad, mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I don&#39;t mind," answered Mrs. Dennison,
kissing her; but she could not help one glance at
Willie Ruston. Bitterly she repented it, for she
found Marjory Valentine following it with her open
sorrowful eyes. She rose abruptly, and Ruston rose
also, and with brief good-nights&mdash;Madge being kissed
only on strong persuasion&mdash;took his leave. The children
flocked away to take off their hats, and Marjory
was left alone with her hostess.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The girl looked pale, weary, and sad. Mrs. Dennison
was stirred to an impulse of compassion. Walking
up to where she sat, she bent down as though to
kiss her. Marjory looked up. There was a question&mdash;it
seemed to be a question&mdash;in her face. Mrs. Dennison
flushed red from neck to forehead, and then
grew paler than the pallor she had pitied. The girl&#39;s
unspoken question seemed to echo hauntingly from
every corner of the little room, "Are your lips&mdash;clean?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>A SOUND IN THE NIGHT.</h3>

<p class="indent">Slow in forming, swift in acting; slow in the
making, swift in the working; slow to the summit,
swift down the other slope; it is the way of nature,
and the way of the human mind. What seemed yesterday
unborn and impossible, is to-day incipient and
a great way off, to-morrow complete, present, and accomplished.
After long labour a thing springs forth
full grown; to deny it, or refuse it, or fight against it,
seems now as vain as a few hours ago it was to hope
for it, or to fear, or to imagine, or conceive it. In
like manner, the slow, crawling, upward journey can
be followed by every eye; its turns, its twists, its
checks, its zigzags may be recorded on a chart. Then
is the brief pause&mdash;on the summit&mdash;and the tottering
incline towards the declivity. But how describe what
comes after? The dazzling rush that beats the eye,
that in its fury of advance, its paroxysm of speed, is
void of halts or turns, and, darting from point to
point, covers and blurs the landscape till there seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
nothing but the moving thing; and that again, while
the watcher still tries vainly to catch its whirl, has
sprung, and reached, and ceased; and, save that there
it was and here it is, he would not know that its fierce
stir had been.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a race runs passion to its goal, when the reins
hang loose. Hours may do what years have not done,
and minutes sum more changes than long days could
stretch to hold. The world narrows till there would
seem to be nothing else existent in it&mdash;nothing of all
that once held out the promise (sure as it then claimed
to be) of escape, of help, or warning. The very promise
is forgotten, the craving for its fulfilment dies
away. "Let me alone," is the only cry; and the appeal
makes its own answer, the entreaty its own concession.</p>

<p class="indent">Some thirty hours had passed since the last
recorded scene, and Marjory Valentine was still under
Mrs. Dennison&#39;s roof. It had been hard to stay, but
the girl would not give up her self-imposed hopeless
task. Helpless she had proved, and hopeless she had
become. The day had passed with hardly a word
spoken between her and her hostess. Mrs. Dennison
had been out the greater part of the time, and, when
out, she had been with Ruston. She had come in to
dinner at half-past seven, and at nine had gone to her
room, pleading fatigue and a headache. Marjory had
sat up a little longer, with an unopened book on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
knee. Then she also went to bed, and tried vainly to
sleep. She had left her bed now, and, wrapped in a
dressing-gown, sat in a low arm-chair near the window.
It was a dark and still night; a thick fog hung
over the little garden; nothing was to be heard save
the gentle roll of a quiet sea, and the occasional blast
of a steam whistle. Marjory&#39;s watch had stopped, but
she guessed it to be somewhere in the small hours of
the morning&mdash;one o&#39;clock, perhaps, or nearing two.
There was an infinite weary time, then, before the sun
would shine again, and the oppression of the misty
darkness be lifted off. She hated the night&mdash;this
night&mdash;it savoured not of rest to her, but of death;
for she was wrought to a nervous strain, and felt her
imaginings taking half-bodily shapes about her, so
that she was fearful of looking to the right hand or
the left. Sleep was impossible; to try to sleep like a
surrender to the mysterious enemies round her. Time
seemed to stand still; she counted sixty once, to mark
a minute&#39;s flight, and the counting took an eternity.
The house was utterly noiseless, and she shivered at
the silence. She would have given half her life, she
felt, for a ray of the sun; but half a life stretched between
her and the first break of morning. Sitting
there, she heaped terrors round her; the superstitions
that hide their heads before daytime mockery reared
them now in victory and made a prey of her. The
struggle she had in her weakness entered on seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
less now with human frailty than against the strong
and evil purpose of some devil; in face of which she
was naught. How should she be? She had not, she
told herself in morbid upbraiding, even a pure motive
in the fight; her hatred of the sin had been less keen
had she not once desired the love of him that caused
it, and when she arrested Maggie Dennison&#39;s kiss, she
shamed a rival in rebuking an unfaithful wife. Then
she cried rebelliously against her anguish. Why had
this come on her, darkening bright youth? Why was
she compassed about with trouble? And why&mdash;why&mdash;why
did not the morning come?</p>

<p class="indent">The mist was thick and grey against the window.
A fog-horn roared, and the sea, regardless, repeated
its even beat; behind the feeble interruptions there
sounded infinite silence. She hid her face in her
hands. Then she leapt up and flung the window open
wide. The damp fog-folds settled on her face, but
she heard the sea more plainly, and there were sounds
in the air about her. It was not so terribly quiet.
She peered eagerly through the mist, but saw nothing
save vague tremulous shapes, vacant of identity. Still
the world, the actual, earthly, healthy world, was
there&mdash;a refuge from imagination.</p>

<p class="indent">She stood looking; and, as she looked, one shape
seemed to grow into a nearer likeness of something
definite. It was motionless; it differed from the rest
only in being darker and of rather sharper outline.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
It must be a tree, she thought, but remembered no
tree there; the garden held only low-growing shrubs.
A post? But the gate lay to the right, and this stood
on her left hand, hard by the door of the house.
What then? The terror came on her again, but she
stood and looked, longing to find some explanation
for it&mdash;some meaning on which her mind could rest,
and, reassured, drive away its terrifying fancies. For
the shape was large in the mist, and she could not tell
what it might mean. Was it human? On her superstitious
mood the thought flashed bright with sudden
relief, and she cried beseechingly,</p>

<p class="indent">"Who is it? Who is there?"</p>

<p class="indent">A human voice in answer would have been heaven
to her, but no answer came. With a stifled cry, she
shut the window down, and stood a moment, listening&mdash;eager,
yet fearful, to hear. Hark! Yes, there was
a sound! What was it? It was a footstep on the
gravel&mdash;a slow, uncertain, wavering, intermittent step,
as though of someone groping with hesitating feet
and doubtful resolution through the mist. She must
know what it was&mdash;who it was&mdash;what it meant. She
started up again, laying both hands on the window-sash.
But then terror conquered curiosity; gasping
as if breath failed her and something still pursued, she
ran across the room and flung open the door. She
must find someone&mdash;Maggie or someone.</p>

<p class="indent">On the threshold she paused in amazement. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
door of Mrs. Dennison&#39;s room was open, and Maggie
stood in the doorway, holding a candle, behind which
her face gleamed pale and her eyes shone. She was
muffled in a long white wrapper, and her dark hair
fell over her shoulders. The candle shook in her
hand, but, on sight of Marjory, her lips smiled beneath
her deep shining eyes. Marjory ran to her crying,</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it you, Maggie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Who should it be?" asked Mrs. Dennison, still
smiling, so well as her fast-beating breath allowed her.
"Why aren&#39;t you in bed?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl grasped her hand, and pushed her back
into the room.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, I&mdash;&mdash;Hark! there it is again! There&#39;s
something outside&mdash;there, in the garden! If you open
the window&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, Mrs. Dennison darted quick on silent
naked feet to the window, and stood by it; but she
seemed rather to intercept approach to it than to
think of opening it. Indeed there was no need. The
slow uncertain step sounded again; there were five or
six seeming footfalls, and the women stood motionless,
listening to them. Then there was stillness outside,
matching the hush within; till Maggie Dennison,
tearing the wrapper loose from her throat, said in low
tones,</p>

<p class="indent">"I hear nothing outside;" and she put the candle
on the table by her. "You can see nothing for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
fog," she added as she gazed through the glass. Her
tone was strangely full of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">"I opened the window," whispered Marjory, "and
I saw&mdash;I thought I saw&mdash;something. And then I heard&mdash;that.
You heard it, Maggie?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl was standing in the middle of the room,
her eyes fixed on Mrs. Dennison, who leant against the
window-sash with a strained, alert, watchful look on
her face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I heard you open the window and call out something,"
she said. "That&#39;s all I heard."</p>

<p class="indent">"But just now&mdash;just now as we stood here?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison did not answer for a moment; her
ear was almost against the panes, and her face was
like a runner&#39;s as he waits for the starter&#39;s word.
There was nothing but the gentle beat of the sea.
Mrs. Dennison pushed her hair back over her shoulders
and sighed; her tense frame relaxed, and the
fixed smile on her lips seemed, in broadening, to lose
something of its rigidity.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I didn&#39;t, you silly child," she said. "You&#39;re
full of fancies, Marjory."</p>

<p class="indent">The curl of her lip and the shrug of her shoulders
won no attention.</p>

<p class="indent">"It went across the garden from the door&mdash;across
towards the gate," said Marjory, "towards the path
down. I heard it. It came from near the door. I
heard it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison shook her head. The girl sprang
forward and again caught her by the arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"You heard too?" she cried. "I know you heard!"
and a challenge rang in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t hear," she repeated impatiently, "but I
daresay you did. Perhaps it was a man&mdash;a thief, or
somebody lost in the fog. Would you like me to wake
the footman? I can tell him to take a lantern and
look if anyone&#39;s in the garden."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory took no notice of the offer.</p>

<p class="indent">"But if it was anyone, he&#39;ll have gone now," continued
Maggie Dennison, "your opening the window
will have frightened him. You made such a noise&mdash;you
woke me up."</p>

<p class="indent">"Were you asleep?" came in quick question.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," answered Mrs. Dennison steadily, "I was
asleep. Couldn&#39;t you sleep?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sleep? No, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I was afraid."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re as bad as the children," said Mrs. Dennison,
laughing gently. "Come, go back to bed. Shall
I come and sit by you till it&#39;s light?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl seemed not to hear; she drew nearer,
searching Mrs. Dennison&#39;s face with suspicious eyes.
Maggie could not face her; she dropped her glance to
the floor and laughed nervously and fretfully. Suddenly
Marjory threw herself on the floor at her friend&#39;s
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, come away from here," she beseeched.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
"Do come; do come away directly. Maggie, dear, I
love you so, and&mdash;and I was unkind last night. Do
come, darling! We&#39;ll go back together&mdash;back home,"
and she burst into sobbing.</p>

<p class="indent">Maggie Dennison stood passive and motionless, her
hands by her side. Her lips quivered and she looked
down at the girl kneeling at her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Won&#39;t you come?" moaned Marjory. "Oh, Maggie,
there&#39;s still time!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison knew what she meant. A strange
smile came over her face. Yes, there was time; in a
sense there was time, for the uncertain footfalls had
not reached their goal&mdash;arrested by that cry from the
window, they had stopped&mdash;wavered&mdash;retreated&mdash;and
were gone. Because a girl had not slept, there was
time. Yet what difference did it make that there was
still time&mdash;to-night? Since to-morrow was coming
and must come.</p>

<p class="indent">"Time!" she echoed in a whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">"For God&#39;s sake, come, Maggie! Come to-morrow&mdash;you
and the children. Come back with them to
England! Maggie, I can&#39;t stay here!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison put out her hands and took Marjory&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">"Get up," she said, almost roughly, and dragged
the girl to her feet. "You can go, Marjory; I&mdash;I
suppose you&#39;re not happy here. You can go."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I shan&#39;t go," said Maggie Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory, standing now, shrank back from her.</p>

<p class="indent">"You won&#39;t go?" she whispered. "Why, what
are you staying for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You forget," said Mrs. Dennison coldly. "I&#39;m
waiting for my husband."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" moaned Marjory, a world of misery and
contempt in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">At the tone Mrs. Dennison&#39;s face grew rigid, and,
if it could be, paler than before; she had been called
"liar" to her face, and truly. It was lost to-night
her madness mourned&mdash;hoped for to-morrow that held
her in her place.</p>

<p class="indent">The fog was lifting outside; the darkness grew
less dense; a distant, dim, cold light began to reveal
the day.</p>

<p class="indent">"See, it&#39;s morning," said Mrs. Dennison. "You
needn&#39;t be afraid any longer. Won&#39;t you go back to
your own room, Marjory?"</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory nodded. She wore a helpless bewildered
look, and she did not speak. She started to cross the
room, when Mrs. Dennison asked her,</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mean to go this morning? I suppose
the Seminghams will take you, if you like. We can
make some excuse if you like."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory stood still, then she sank on a chair
near her, and began to sob quietly. Mrs. Dennison
slowly walked to her, and stood by her. Then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
gently and timidly, she laid her hand on the girl&#39;s
head.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t cry," she said. "Why should you cry?"</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory clutched her hand, crying,</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, Maggie, don&#39;t, don&#39;t!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison&#39;s eyes filled with tears. She let her
hand lie passive till the girl released it, and, looking
up, said,</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m not going, Maggie. I shall stay. Don&#39;t
send me away! Let me stay till Mr. Dennison
comes."</p>

<p class="indent">"What&#39;s the use? You&#39;re unhappy here."</p>

<p class="indent">"Can&#39;t I help you?" asked the girl, so low that it
seemed as though she were afraid to hear her own
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison&#39;s self-control suddenly gave way.</p>

<p class="indent">"Help!" she cried recklessly. "No, you can&#39;t
help. Nobody can help. It&#39;s too late for anyone to
help now."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl raised her head with a start.</p>

<p class="indent">"Too late! Maggie, you mean&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no, no," cried Mrs. Dennison, and then her
eager cry died swiftly away.</p>

<p class="indent">Why protest in horror? By no grace of hers was
it that it was not too late. The girl&#39;s eyes were on
her, and she stammered,</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean nothing&mdash;nothing. Yes, you must go.
I hate&mdash;no, no! Marjory, don&#39;t push me away! Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
me touch you! There&#39;s no reason I shouldn&#39;t touch
you. I mean, I love you, but&mdash;I can&#39;t have you here."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not?" came from the girl in slow, strong
tones.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later, she sprang to her feet, her eyes
full of new horror, as the vague suspicion grew to a
strange undoubting certainty.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who was it in the garden? Who was out there?
Maggie, if I hadn&#39;t&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">She could not end. On the last words her voice
sank to a fearful whisper; when she had uttered them&mdash;with
their unfinished, yet plain and naked, question&mdash;she
hid her face in her hands, listening for the answer.</p>

<p class="indent">A minute&mdash;two minutes&mdash;passed. There was no
sound but Maggie Dennison&#39;s quick breathings; once
she started forward with her lips parted as if to speak,
and a look of defiance on her face; once too, entreaty,
hope, tenderness dawned for a moment. In anger or
in sorrow, the truth was hard on being uttered; but
the impulse failed. She arrested the words on her lips,
and with an angry jerk of her head, said petulantly,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you&#39;re a silly girl, and you make me silly too.
There&#39;s nothing the matter. I don&#39;t know who it was
or what it was. Very likely it was nothing. I heard
nothing. It was all your imagination." Her voice
grew harder, colder, more restrained as she went on.
"Don&#39;t think about what I&#39;ve said to-night&mdash;and don&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
chatter about it. You upset me with your fancies.
Marjory, it means nothing."</p>

<p class="indent">The last words were imperative in their insistence,
but all the answer Marjory made was to raise her head
and ask,</p>

<p class="indent">"Am I to go?" while her eyes added, too plainly
for Maggie Dennison not to read them, "You know
the meaning of that."</p>

<p class="indent">Under the entreaty and the challenge of her eyes,
Mrs. Dennison could not give the answer which it was
her purpose to give&mdash;the answer which would deny
the mad hope that still filled her, the hope which still
cried that, though to-night was gone, there was to-morrow.
It was the answer she must make to all the
world&mdash;which she must declare and study to confirm
in all her acts and bearing. But there&mdash;alone with
the girl&mdash;under the compelling influence of the reluctant
confidence&mdash;that impossibility of open falsehood&mdash;which
the time and occasion seemed strangely to
build up between them&mdash;she could not give it plainly.
She dared not bid the girl stay, with that hope at her
heart; she dared not cast away the cloak by bidding
her go.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must do as you like," she said at last. "I
can&#39;t help you about it."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory caught at the narrow chance the answer
left her; with returning tenderness she stretched out
her hands towards her friend, saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, do tell me! I shall believe what you
tell me."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison drew back from the contact of the
outstretched hands. Marjory rose, and for an instant
they stood looking at one another. Then Marjory
turned, and walked slowly to the door. To her own
room she went, to fear and to hope, if hope she could.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison was left alone. The night was far
gone, the morning coming apace. Her lips moved, as
she gazed from the window. Was it in thanksgiving
for the escape of the night, or in joy that the morrow
was already to-day? She could not tell; yes, she was
glad&mdash;surely she was glad? Yet, as at last she flung
herself upon her bed, she murmured, "He&#39;ll come
early to-day," and then she sobbed in shame.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>ON THE MATTER OF A RAILWAY.</h3>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston was half-dressed when the chamber-maid
knocked at his door. He opened it and
took from her three or four letters. Laying them on
the table he finished his dressing&mdash;with him a quick
process, devoid of the pleasant lounging by which
many men cheat its daily tiresomeness. At last, when
his coat was on, he walked two or three times up and
down the room, frowning, smiling for an instant,
frowning long again. Then he jerked his head impatiently
as though he had had too much of his
thoughts, and, going to the table, looked at the addresses
on his letters. With a sudden access of eagerness
he seized on one and tore it open. It bore Carlin&#39;s
handwriting, and he groaned to see that the four
sides were close-filled. Old Carlin was terribly verbose
and roundabout in his communications, and a
bored look settled on Willie Ruston&#39;s face as he read
a wilderness of small details, skirmishes with unruly
clerks, iniquities of office-boys, lamentations on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
apathy of the public, and lastly, a conscientious account
of the health of the writer&#39;s household. With
a sigh he turned the second page.</p>

<p class="indent">"By the way," wrote Carlin, "I have had a letter
from Detchmore. He draws back about the railway,
and says the Government won&#39;t sanction it."</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston raced through the rest, muttering
to himself as he read, "Why the deuce didn&#39;t he wire?
What an old fool it is!" and so forth. Then he flung
down the letter, put his hands deep in his pockets and
stood motionless for a few moments.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must go at once," he said aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">He stood thinking, and a rare expression stole over
his face. It showed a doubt, a hesitation, a faltering&mdash;the
work and the mark of the day and the night
that were gone. He walked about again; he went to
the window and stared out, jangling the money in his
pockets. For nearly five minutes that expression was
on his face. For nearly five minutes&mdash;and it seemed
no short time&mdash;he was torn by conflicting forces. For
nearly five minutes he wavered in his allegiance, and
Omofaga had a rival that could dispute its throne.
Then his brow cleared and his lips shut tight again.
He had made up his mind; great as the thing was
that held him where he was, yet he must go, and the
thing must wait. Wheeling round, he took up the
letter and, passing quickly through the door, went to
young Sir Walter&#39;s room, with the face of a man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
knows grief and vexation but has set wavering behind
him.</p>

<p class="indent">It was an hour later when Adela Ferrars and the
Seminghams sat down to their coffee. A fourth plate
was laid at the table, and Adela was in very good
spirits. Tom Loring had arrived; they had greeted
him, and he was upstairs making himself fit to be
seen after a night-voyage; his boat had lain three
hours outside the harbour waiting for the fog to lift.
"I daresay," said Tom, "you heard our horn bellowing."
But he was here at last, and Adela was merrier
than she had been in all her stay at Dieppe. Semingham
also was happy; it was a great relief to feel that
there was someone to whom responsibility properly, or
at least more properly, belonged, and an end, therefore,
to all unjustifiable attempts to saddle mere onlookers
with it. And Lady Semingham perceived
that her companions were in more genial mood than
lately had been their wont, and expanded in the
warmer air. When Tom came down nothing could
exceed the <i>empressement</i> of his welcome.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun had scattered the last remnants of fog,
and, on Semingham&#39;s proposal, the party passed from
the table to a seat in the hotel garden, whence they
could look at the sea. Here they became rather more
silent; for Adela began to feel that the hour of explanation
was approaching, and grew surer and surer
that to her would be left the task. She believed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
Tom was tactful enough to spare her most of it, but
something she must say&mdash;and to say anything was
terribly difficult. Lord Semingham was treating the
visit as though there were nothing behind; and his
wife had no inkling that there was anything behind.
The wife&#39;s genius for not observing was matched by
the husband&#39;s wonderful power of ignoring; and if
Adela had allowed herself to translate into words the
exasperated promptings of her quick temper, she
would have declared a desire to box the ears of both
of them. It would have been vulgar, but entirely
satisfactory.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Tom, with carefully-prepared nonchalance,
asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, and how is Mrs. Dennison?"</p>

<p class="indent">Bessie Semingham assumed the question to herself.</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s very well, thank you, Mr. Loring. Dieppe
has done her a world of good."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela pursed her lips together. Semingham,
catching her eye, smothered a nascent smile. Tom
frowned slightly, and, leaning forward, clasped his
hands between his knees. He was guilty of wishing
that Bessie Semingham had more pressing avocations
that morning.</p>

<p class="indent">"You see," she chirruped, "Marjory&#39;s with her,
and the children dote on Marjory, and she&#39;s got Mr.
Ruston and Walter to wait on her&mdash;you know Maggie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
always likes somebody in her train. Well, Alfred,
why shouldn&#39;t I say that? I like to have someone
myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t speak," protested Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, but you looked funny. I always say about
Maggie, Mr. Loring, that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">All three were listening in some embarrassment;
out of the mouths of babes come sometimes alarming
things.</p>

<p class="indent">"That without any apparent trouble she can make
her clothes look better than anybody I know."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham laughed; even Adela and Tom
smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a blessed irrelevance you have, my dear,"
said Semingham, stroking his wife&#39;s small hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Semingham smiled delightedly and blushed
prettily. She enjoyed Alfred&#39;s praise. He was so
<i>difficile</i> as a rule. The exact point of the word "irrelevance"
she did not stay to consider; she had
evidently said something that pleased him. A moment
later she rose with a smile, crying,</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, Mr. Ruston, how good of you to come
round so early!"</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston shook hands with her in hasty politeness.
A nod to Semingham, a lift of the hat to
Adela, left him face to face with Tom Loring, who
got up slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, Loring, how are you?" said Willie holding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
out his hand. "Young Val told me you were to arrive
to-day. How did you get across? Uncommon foggy,
wasn&#39;t it?"</p>

<p class="indent">By this time he had taken Tom&#39;s hand and shaken
it, Tom being purely passive.</p>

<p class="indent">"By the way, you&#39;re all wrong about the water,
you know," he continued, in sudden remembrance.
"There&#39;s enough water to supply Manchester within
ten miles of Fort Imperial. What? Why, man, I&#39;ll
show you the report when we get back to town; good
water, too. I had it analysed, and&mdash;well, it&#39;s all
right; but I haven&#39;t time to talk about it now. The
fact is, Semingham, I came round to tell you that
I&#39;m off."</p>

<p class="indent">"Off?" exclaimed Semingham, desperately fumbling
for his eyeglass.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela clasped her hands, and her eyes sparkled.
Tom scrutinised Willie Ruston with attentive eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; to-day&mdash;in an hour; boat goes at 11:30.
I&#39;ve had a letter from old Carlin. Things aren&#39;t going
well. That ass Detch&mdash;&mdash;By Jove, though, I forgot
you, Loring! I don&#39;t want to give you materials
for another of those articles."</p>

<p class="indent">His rapidity, his bustle, his good humour were all
amazing.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom glanced in bewilderment at Adela. Adela
coloured deeply. She felt that she had no adequate
reason to give for having summoned Tom Loring to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
Dieppe, unless (she brightened as the thought struck
her) Tom had frightened Ruston away.</p>

<p class="indent">Willie seized Semingham&#39;s arm, and began to walk
him (the activity seemed all on Willie&#39;s part) quickly
up and down the garden. He held Carlin&#39;s letter in
his hand, and he talked eagerly and fast, beating the
letter with his fist now and again. Bessie Semingham
sat down with an amiable smile. Adela and Tom
were close together. Adela lifted her eyes to Tom&#39;s
in question.</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think it&#39;s true?" she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s the finest actor alive if it isn&#39;t," said Tom,
watching the beats of Ruston&#39;s fist.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then thank heaven! But I feel so foolish."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush! here they come," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no time for more.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom, there&#39;s riches in it for you if we told you,"
laughed Semingham; "but Ruston&#39;s going to put it
all right."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom gave a not very easy laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Fancy old Carlin not wiring!" exclaimed Willie
Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall I sell?" asked Adela, trying to be frivolous.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hold for your life, Miss Ferrars," said Willie;
and going up to Bessie Semingham he held out his
hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"What, are you really off? It&#39;s too bad of you,
Mr. Ruston! Not that I&#39;ve seen much of you. Maggie
has quite monopolised you."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela and Tom looked at the ground. Semingham
turned his back; his smile would not be smothered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course you&#39;re going to say good-bye to her?"
pursued Lady Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom looked up, and Adela followed his example.
They were rewarded&mdash;if it were a reward&mdash;by seeing a
slight frown&mdash;the first shadow since he had been with
them&mdash;on Ruston&#39;s brow. But he answered briskly,
with a glance at his watch,</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t manage it. I should miss the boat. I
must write her a line."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, she&#39;ll never forgive you," cried Lady Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes, she will," he laughed. "It&#39;s for Omofaga,
you know. Good-bye. Good-bye. I&#39;m awfully
sorry to go. Good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">He was gone. It was difficult to realise at first.
His presence, the fact of him, had filled so large a
space; it had been the feature of the place from the
day he had joined them. It had been their interest
and their incubus.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment the three stood staring at one
another; then Semingham, with a curious laugh,
turned on his heel and went into the house. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
wife unfolded yesterday&#39;s <i>Morning Post</i> and began
to read.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come for a stroll," said Tom Loring to Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">She accompanied him in silence, and they walked
a hundred yards or more before she spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a blessing!" she said then. "I wonder if
your coming sent him away?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, it was genuine," declared Tom, with conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I was very wrong, or he&#39;s a most extraordinary
man. I can&#39;t talk to you about it, Mr. Loring,
but you told me I might send. And I did think it&mdash;desirable&mdash;when
I wrote. I did, indeed. I hope
you&#39;re not very much annoyed?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Annoyed! No; I was delighted to come. And
I am still more delighted that it looks as if I wasn&#39;t
wanted."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you&#39;re wanted, anyhow," said Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">She was very happy in his coming, and could not
help showing it a little. Fortunately, it was tolerably
certain (as she felt sometimes, intolerably certain) that
Tom Loring would not notice anything. He never
seemed to consider it possible that people might be
particularly glad to see him.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you can stay, can&#39;t you?" she added.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes; I can stay a bit. I should like to.
What made you send?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You know. I can&#39;t possibly describe it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Did Semingham notice it too?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, he did, Mr. Loring. I distrust that man&mdash;Mr.
Ruston I mean&mdash;utterly. And Maggie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s wrapped up in him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Terribly. I tried to think it was his wretched
Omofaga; but it&#39;s not; it&#39;s him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he&#39;s disposed of."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, indeed," she sighed, in complacent ignorance.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must go and see her, you know," said Tom,
wrinkling his brow.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"What&#39;ll she say to me?" asked Tom anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, she&#39;ll be very pleasant."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shan&#39;t," said Tom with sudden decision.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela looked at him curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean to&mdash;to give her &#39;a bit of your mind?&#39;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, yes," he answered, smiling. "I think so;
don&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I should like to, if I dared."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, you dare anything!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no, I don&#39;t. I splash about a good deal, but
I am a coward, really."</p>

<p class="indent">They relapsed into silence. Presently Tom began,</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s been awfully dull in town; nobody to speak
to, except Mrs. Cormack."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Cormack!" cried Adela. "I thought you
hated her?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;ve thought a little better of her lately."</p>

<p class="indent">"To think of your making friends with Mrs. Cormack!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I haven&#39;t made friends with her. She&#39;s not such
a bad woman as you&#39;d think, though."</p>

<p class="indent">"I think she&#39;s horrible," said Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom gave it up.</p>

<p class="indent">"There was no one else," he pleaded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," retorted Adela, "when there is anyone
else, you never come near them."</p>

<p class="indent">The grammar was confused, but Adela could not
improve it, without being landed in unbearable plainness
of speech.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t I?" he asked. "Why, I come and see
you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, for twenty minutes once a month; just to
keep the acquaintance open, I suppose. It&#39;s like shutting
all the gates on Ascension Day (isn&#39;t it Ascension
Day?), only the other way round, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"You so often quarrel with me," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"What nonsense!" said Adela. "Anyhow, I
won&#39;t quarrel here."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom glanced at her. She was looking bright and
happy and young. He liked her even better here in
Dieppe than in a London drawing-room. Her conversation
was not so elaborate, but it was more spontaneous
and, to his mind, pleasanter. Moreover, the
sea air had put colour in her cheeks and painted her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
complexion afresh. The thought strayed through
Tom&#39;s mind that she was looking quite handsome. It
was the one good thing that he did not always think
about her. He went on studying her till she suddenly
turned and caught him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," she asked, with a laugh and a blush, "do
I wear well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You always talk as if you were seventy," said
Tom reprovingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela laughed merrily. The going of Ruston and
the coming of Tom were almost too much good-fortune
for one day. And Tom had come in a pleasant
mood.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t really like Mrs. Cormack, do you?"
she asked. "She hates me, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, if I have to choose between you&mdash;&mdash;" said
Tom, and stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">"You stop at the critical moment."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Mrs. Cormack isn&#39;t here," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"So I shall do to pass the time?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he laughed; and then they both laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">But suddenly Adela&#39;s laugh ceased, and she
jumped up.</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s Marjory Valentine!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"What! Where?" asked Tom, rising.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, stay where you are, I want to speak to her.
I&#39;ll come back," and, leaving Tom, she sped after
Marjory, calling her name.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Marjory looked round and hastened to meet her.
She was pale and her eyes heavy for trouble and want
of sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Adela, I&#39;m so glad to find you! I was going
to look for you at the hotel. I must talk to you."</p>

<p class="indent">"You shall," said Adela, taking her arm and
smiling again.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not notice Marjory&#39;s looks; she was full
of her own tidings.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want to ask you whether you think Lady Semingham&mdash;&mdash;"
began Marjory, growing red, and in
great embarrassment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, but hear my news first," cried Adela; "Marjory,
he&#39;s gone!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Who?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, that man Mr. Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">"Gone?" echoed Marjory in amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">To her it seemed incredible that he should be
gone&mdash;strange perhaps to Adela, but to her incredible.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, this morning. He got a letter&mdash;something
about his Company&mdash;and he was off on the spot.
And Tom&mdash;Mr. Loring (he&#39;s come, you know), thinks&mdash;that
that really was his reason, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory listened with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Adela!" she said at last with a sort of
shudder.</p>

<p class="indent">She could have believed it of no other man; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
could hardly believe it of one who now seemed to her
hardly a man.</p>

<p class="indent">"Isn&#39;t it splendid? And he went off without seeing&mdash;without
going up to the cliff at all. I never
was so delighted in my life."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory was silent. No delight showed on her
face; the time for that was gone. She did not
understand, and she was thinking of the night&#39;s
experience and wondering if Maggie Dennison had
known that he was going. No, she could not have
known.</p>

<p class="indent">"But what did you want with me, or with
Bessie?" asked Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory hesitated. The departure of Willie Ruston
made a difference. She prayed that it meant an
utter difference. There was a chance; and while
there was a chance her place was in the villa on the
cliff. His going rekindled the spark of hope that
almost had died in the last terrible night.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think," she said slowly, "that I&#39;ll go straight
back."</p>

<p class="indent">"And tell Maggie?" asked Adela with excited
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"If she doesn&#39;t know."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela said nothing; the subject was too perilous.
She even regretted having said so much; but she
pressed her friend&#39;s arm approvingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"It doesn&#39;t matter about Lady Semingham just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
now," said Marjory in an absent sort of tone. "It
will do later."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re not looking well," remarked Adela, who
had at last looked at her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I had a bad night."</p>

<p class="indent">"And how&#39;s Maggie?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl paused a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">"I haven&#39;t seen her this morning. She sent word
that she would breakfast in bed. I&#39;ll just run up
now, Adela."</p>

<p class="indent">She walked off rapidly. Adela watched her, feeling
uneasy about her. There was a strange constraint
about her manner&mdash;a hint of something suppressed&mdash;and
it was easy to see that she was nervous and unhappy.
But Adela, making lighter of her old fears
in her new-won comfort, saw only in Marjory a grief
that is very sad to bear, a sorrow that comes where
love&mdash;or what is nearly love&mdash;meets with indifference.</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s still thinking about that creature!" said
Adela to herself in scorn and in pity. She had quite
made up her mind about Willie Ruston now. "I&#39;m
awfully sorry for her." Adela, in fact, felt very sympathetic.
For the same thing might well happen
with love that rested on a worthier object than "that
creature, Willie Ruston!"</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the creature&mdash;could he himself at the
moment have quarrelled with the word?&mdash;was carried
over the waves, till the cliff and the house on it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
dipped and died away. The excitement of the message
and the start was over; the duty that had been
strong enough to take him away could not yet be
done. A space lay bare&mdash;exposed to the thoughts
that fastened on it. Who could have escaped their
assault? Not even Willie Ruston was proof; and his
fellow-voyagers wondered at the man with the frowning
brows and fretful restless eyes. It had not been
easy to do, or pleasant to see done, this last sacrifice
to the god of his life. Yet it had been done, with
hardly a hesitation. He paced the deck, saying to
himself, "She&#39;ll understand." Would any woman?
If any, then, without doubt, she was the woman.
"Oh, she&#39;ll understand," he muttered petulantly,
angry with himself because he would not be convinced.
Once, in despair, he tried to tell himself that
this end to it was what people would call ordered for
the best&mdash;that it was an escape for him&mdash;still more
for her. But his strong, self-penetrating sense pushed
the plea aside&mdash;in him it was hypocrisy, the merest
conventionality. He had not even the half-stifled
thanksgiving for respite from a doom still longed for,
which had struggled for utterance in Maggie&#39;s sobs.
Yet he had something that might pass for it&mdash;a feeling
that made even him start in the knowledge of its
degradation. By fate, or accident, or mischance&mdash;call
it what he might&mdash;there was nothing irrevocable yet.
He could draw back still. Not thanksgiving for sin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
averted, but a shamefaced sense of an enforced safety
made its way into his mind&mdash;till it was thrust aside
by anger at the check that had baffled him, and by
the longing that was still upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, anyhow&mdash;for good or evil&mdash;willing or unwilling&mdash;he
was away. And she was alone in the
little house on the cliff. His face softened; he ceased
to think of himself for a moment; he thought of her,
as she would look when he did not come&mdash;when he
was false to a tryst never made in words, but surely
the strongest that had ever bound a man. He
clenched his fists as he stood looking from the stern
of the boat, muttering again his old plea, "She&#39;ll understand!"</p>

<p class="indent">Was there not the railway?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>PAST PRAYING FOR.</h3>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison needed not Marjory to tell her.
She had received Willie Ruston&#39;s note just as she was
about to leave her bedroom. It was scribbled in pencil
on half a sheet of notepaper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Am called back to England&mdash;something wrong
about our railway. Very sorry I can&#39;t come and say
good-bye. I shall run back if I can, but I&#39;m afraid
I may be kept in England. Will you write?</p>

<p class="right">"W. R. R."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">She read it, and stood as if changed to stone.
"Something wrong about our railway!" Surely an
all-sufficient reason; the writer had no doubt of that.
He might be kept in England; that meant he would
be, and the writer seemed to see nothing strange in
the fact that he could be. She did not doubt the
truth of what the note said. A man lying would
have piled Pelion on Ossa, reason on reason, excuse on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
excuse, protestation on protestation. Besides Willie
Ruston did not lie. It was just the truth, the all-sufficient
truth. There was something wrong with
the railway, so he left her. He would lose a day if he
missed the boat, so he left her without a word of
farewell. The railway must not suffer for his taking
holiday; her suffering was all his holiday should
make.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly she tore the note into the smallest of fragments,
and the fragments fell at her feet. And his
passionate words were still in her ears, his kisses still
burnt on her cheek. This was the man whom to sway
had been her darling ambition, whom to love was her
great sin, whom to know, as in this moment she
seemed to know him, her bitter punishment. In her
heart she cried to heaven, "Enough, enough!"</p>

<p class="indent">The note was his&mdash;his to its last line, its last word,
its last silence. The man stood there, self-epitomised,
callous and careless, unmerciful, unbending, unturning;
vowed to his quest, recking of naught else. But&mdash;she
clung to this, the last plank in her shipwreck&mdash;great&mdash;one
of the few for whom the general must
make stepping-stones. She thought she had been
one of the few; that torn note told her error. Still,
she had held out her hands to ruin for no common
clay&#39;s sake. But it was too hard&mdash;too hard&mdash;too
hard.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you write?" Was he tender there? Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
bitterness would not grant him even that. He did
not want her to slip away. The smallest addition will
make the greatest realm greater, and its loss sully the
king&#39;s majesty. So she must write, as she must think
and dream&mdash;and remember.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps he might choose to come again&mdash;some
day&mdash;and she was to be ready!</p>

<p class="indent">She went downstairs. In the hall she met her
children, and they said something to her; they talked
and chattered to her, and, with the surface of her
mind, she understood; and she listened and answered
and smiled. And all that they had said and she had
said went away; and she found them gone, and herself
alone. Then she passed to the sitting-room,
where was Marjory Valentine, breathless from mounting
the path too quickly; and at sight of Marjory&#39;s
face, she said,</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ve heard from Mr. Ruston. He has been called
away," forestalling Marjory&#39;s trembling words.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she sat down, and there was a long silence.
She was conscious of Marjory there, but the girl did
not speak, and presently the impression of her, which
was very faint, faded altogether away, and Maggie
Dennison seemed to herself alone again&mdash;thinking,
dreaming, and remembering, as she must now think,
dream, and remember&mdash;remembering the day that
was gone, thinking of what this day should have
been.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span></p>

<p class="indent">She sat for an hour, still and idle, looking out
across the sea, and Marjory sat motionless behind,
gazing at her with despair in her eyes. At last the
girl could bear it no longer. It was unnatural, unearthly,
to sit there like that; it was as though, by an
impossibility, a dead soul were clothed with a living
breathing body. Marjory rose and came close, and
called,</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, Maggie!"</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice was clear and louder than her ordinary
tones; she spoke as if trying to force some one to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">Maggie Dennison started, looked round, and passed
her hand rapidly across her brow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, I&mdash;I&#39;ve not done anything about going."</p>

<p class="indent">"Going?" echoed Maggie Dennison. But her
mind was clearing now; her brain had been stunned,
not killed, and her will drove it to wakefulness and
work again. "Going? Oh, I hope not."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know, last night&mdash;&mdash;" began Marjory, timidly,
flushing, keeping behind Mrs. Dennison&#39;s chair.
"Last night we&mdash;we talked about it, but I thought
perhaps now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh," interrupted Mrs. Dennison, "never mind
last night. For goodness&#39; sake, forget last night. I
think we were both mad last night."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory made no answer; and Mrs. Dennison, her
hand having swept her brow once again, turned to her
with awakened and alert eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"You upset me&mdash;and then I upset you. And we
both behaved like hysterical creatures. If I told you
to go, I was silly; and if you said you wanted to go,
you were silly too, Marjory. Of course, you must stop;
and do forget that&mdash;nonsense&mdash;last night."</p>

<p class="indent">Her tone was eager and petulant, the colour was
returning to her cheeks; she looked alive again.</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory leant an arm on the back of the chair,
looking down into Maggie Dennison&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I will stay," she said softly, ignoring everything
else, and then she swiftly stooped and kissed Maggie&#39;s
cheek.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison shivered and smiled, and, detaining
the girl&#39;s head, most graciously returned her caress.
Mrs. Dennison was forgiving everything; by forgiveness
it might be that she could buy of Marjory forgetfulness.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a ring at the door. Marjory looked
through the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s Mr. Loring," she said in a whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">Maggie Dennison smiled&mdash;graciously again.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s very kind of him to come so soon," said she.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall I go?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Go? No, child&mdash;unless you want to. You know
him too. And we&#39;ve no secrets, Tom Loring and I."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom Loring had mounted the hill very slowly.
The giving of that "piece of his mind" seemed not
altogether easy. He might paint poor Harry&#39;s forlorn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
state; Mrs. Dennison would be politely concerned and
politely sceptical about it. He might tell her again&mdash;as
he had told her before&mdash;that Willie Ruston was a
knave and a villain, and she might laugh or be angry,
as her mood was; but she would not believe. Or he
might upbraid her for folly or for worse; and this
was what he wished to do. Would she listen? Probably&mdash;with
a smile on her lips and mocking little compliments
on his friendly zeal and fatherly anxiety. Or
she might flash out on him, and call his charge an insult,
and drive him away; and a word from her would
turn poor old Harry into his enemy. Decidedly his
task was no easy one.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a coward&#39;s joy that he felt when he found a
third person there; but he felt it from the bottom of
his heart. Divine delay! Gracious impossibility!
How often men adore them! Tom Loring gave
thanks, praying silently that Marjory would not withdraw,
shook hands as though his were the most ordinary
morning call, and began to discuss the scenery
of Dieppe, and&mdash;as became a newcomer&mdash;the incidents
of his voyage.</p>

<p class="indent">"And while you were all peacefully in your beds,
we were groping about outside in that abominable
fog," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"How you must have envied us!" smiled Mrs.
Dennison, and Marjory found herself smiling in emulous
hypocrisy. But her smile was very unsuccessful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
and it was well that Tom Loring&#39;s eyes were on his
hostess.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Mrs. Dennison began to talk about Willie
Ruston and her own great interest in him, and in the
Omofaga Company. She was very good-humoured to
Tom Loring, but she did not fail to remind him how
unreasonable he had been&mdash;was still, wasn&#39;t he? The
perfection of her manner frightened Marjory and repelled
her. Yet it would have seemed an effort of
bravery, had it been done with visible struggling. But
it betrayed no effort, and therefore made no show of
bravery.</p>

<p class="indent">"So now," said Maggie Dennison, "since I haven&#39;t
got Mr. Ruston to exchange sympathy with, I must
exchange hostilities with you. It will still be about
Omofaga&mdash;that&#39;s one thing."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom had definitely decided to put off his lecture.
The old manner he had known and mocked and admired&mdash;the
"these-are-the-orders" manner&mdash;was too
strong for him. He believed he was still fond of her.
He knew that he wondered at her still. Could it be
true what they told him&mdash;that she was as a child in
the hands of Willie Ruston? He hated to think that,
because it must mean that Willie Ruston was&mdash;well,
not quite an ordinary person&mdash;a conclusion Tom loathed
to accept.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you&#39;re going to stay some time with the
Seminghams? That&#39;ll be very pleasant. And Adela
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
will like to have you so much.  Oh, you can convert
her! She&#39;s a shareholder. And you must have a talk
to the old Baron. You&#39;ve heard of him? But then
he believes in Mr. Ruston, as I do, so you&#39;ll quarrel
with him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps I shall convert him," suggested Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no, we thorough believers are past praying
for; aren&#39;t we, Marjory?"</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory started.</p>

<p class="indent">"Past praying for?" she echoed.</p>

<p class="indent">Her thoughts had strayed from the conversation&mdash;back
to what she had been bidden to forget; and she
spoke not as one who speaks a trivial phrase.</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant a gleam of something&mdash;anger or
fright&mdash;shot from Maggie Dennison&#39;s eyes. The next,
she was playfully, distantly, delicately chaffing Tom
about the meaning of his sudden arrival.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course <i>not</i>&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p class="indent">And Tom, interrupting, stopped the "Adela."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you stay here too?" he asked, to turn the
conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, of course," smiled Mrs. Dennison. "After
being here all this time, it would look rather funny
if I ran away just when Harry&#39;s coming. I think he
really would have a right to be aggrieved then." She
paused, and added more seriously, "Oh, yes, I shall
wait here for Harry."</p>

<p class="indent">Then Tom Loring rose and took his leave. Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
Dennison entrusted him with an invitation to the
whole of the Seminghams&#39; party to luncheon next
day ("if they don&#39;t mind squeezing into our little
room," she gaily added), and walked with him to the
top of the path, waving her hand to him in friendly
farewell as he began to descend. And, after he was
gone, she stood for a while looking out to sea. Then
she turned. Marjory was in the window and saw her
face as she turned. In a moment Maggie Dennison
saw her looking, and smiled brightly. But the one
short instant had been enough. The feelings first
numbed, then smothered, had in that second sprung
to life, and Marjory shrank back with a little inarticulate
cry of pain and horror. Almost as she uttered
it, Mrs. Dennison was by her side.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;ll go out this afternoon," she said. "I think
I shall lie down for an hour. We managed to rob
ourselves of a good deal of sleep last night. You&#39;d
better do the same." She paused, and then she
added, "You&#39;re a good child, Marjory. You&#39;re very
kind to me."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a quiver in her voice, but it was only
that, and it was Marjory, not she, who burst into
sobs.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush, hush," whispered Maggie Dennison.
"Hush, dear. Don&#39;t do that. Why should you do
that?" and she stroked the girl&#39;s hot cheek, wet with
tears. "I&#39;m very tired, Marjory," she went on. "Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
you think you can dry your eyes&mdash;your silly eyes&mdash;and
help me upstairs? I&mdash;I can hardly stand," and, as
she spoke, she swayed and caught at the curtain by
her, and held herself up by it. "No, I can go
alone!" she exclaimed almost fiercely. "Leave me
alone, Marjory, I can walk. I can walk perfectly;"
and she walked steadily across the room, and Marjory
heard her unwavering step mounting the stairs to her
bedroom.</p>

<p class="indent">But Marjory did not see her enter her room, stop
for a moment over the scraps of torn paper, still lying
on the floor, stoop and gather them one by one, then
put them in an envelope, and the envelope in her
purse, and then throw herself on the bed in an agony
of dumb pain, with the look on her face that had
come for a moment in the garden and came now, fearless
of being driven away, lined strong and deep, as
though graven with some sharp tool.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>THE BARON&#39;S CONTRIBUTION.</h3>

<p class="indent">It may be that the Baron thought he had sucked
the orange of life very dry&mdash;at least, when the cold
winds and the fog had done their work, he accepted
without passionate disinclination the hint that he
must soon take his lips from the fruit. He went to
bed and made a codicil to his will, having it executed
and witnessed with every requisite formality. Then
he announced to Lord Semingham, who came to see
him, that, according to his doctor&#39;s opinion and his
own, he might manage to breathe a week longer; and
Semingham, looking upon him, fancied, without saying,
that the opinion was a sanguine one. This happened
five days before Harry Dennison&#39;s arrival at
Dieppe.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am very fortunate," said the Baron, "to have
found such kind friends for the last stage;" and he
looked from Lady Semingham&#39;s flowers to Adela&#39;s
grapes. "I could have bought them, of course," he
added. "I&#39;ve always been able to buy&mdash;everything."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The old man smiled as he spoke, and Semingham
smiled also.</p>

<p class="indent">"This," continued the Baron, "is the third time I
have been laid up like this."</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s luck in odd numbers," observed Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"But which would be luck?" asked the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, there you gravel me," admitted Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"I came here against orders, because I must needs
poke my old nose into this concern of yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not of mine."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of yours and others. Well, I poked it in&mdash;and
the frost has caught the end of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t take any particular pleasure in the concern
myself," said Semingham, "and I wish you&#39;d
kept your nose out, and yourself in a more balmy climate."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear Lord, the market is rising."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know," smiled Semingham. "Tom Loring
can&#39;t make out who the fools are who are buying. He
said so this morning."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron began to laugh, but a cough choked his
mirth.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s an honest and an able man, your Loring;
but he doesn&#39;t see clear in everything. I&#39;ve been buying,
myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you have?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and someone has been selling&mdash;selling largely&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
the price would have been driven higher. It is
you, perhaps, my friend?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a share. I have the vices of an aristocracy.
I am stubborn."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It might be&mdash;Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"But what did you want with &#39;em, Baron? Will
they pay?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I doubt that. But I wanted them. Why
should Dennison sell?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose he doubts, like you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps it is that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps," said Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">In the course of the next three days they had
many conversations; the talks did the Baron no good
nor, as his doctor significantly said, any harm; and
when he could not talk, Semingham sat by him and
told stories. He spoke too, frequently, of Willie Ruston,
and of the Company&mdash;that interested the Baron.
And at last, on the third day, they began to speak of
Maggie Dennison; but neither of them connected the
two names in talk. Indeed Semingham, according to
his custom, had rushed at the possibility of ignoring
such connection. Ruston&#39;s disappearance had shown
him a way; and he embraced the happy chance. He
was always ready to think that any "fuss" was a mistake;
and, as he told the Baron, Mrs. Dennison had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
been in great spirits lately, cheered up, it seemed, by
the prospect of her husband&#39;s immediate arrival. The
Baron smiled to hear him; then he asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think she would come to see me?"</p>

<p class="indent">Semingham promised to ask her; and, although
the Baron was fit to see nobody the next day&mdash;for he
had moved swiftly towards his journey&#39;s end in those
twenty-four hours&mdash;yet Mrs. Dennison came and was
admitted; and, at sight of the Baron, who lay yellow
and gasping, forgot both her acting and, for an
instant, the reality which it hid.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" she cried before she could stop herself,
"how ill you look! Let me make you comfortable!"</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron did not deny her. He had something
to say to her.</p>

<p class="indent">"When does your husband come?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"To-morrow," said she briefly.</p>

<p class="indent">She did all she could for his comfort, and then sat
down by his bedside. He had an interval of some
freedom from oppression and his mind was clear and
concentrated.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want to tell you," he began, "something that
I have done." He paused, and added a question,
"Ruston does not come back to Dieppe, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think not. He is detained on business," she
answered, "and he will be more tied when my husband
leaves."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Your husband will not long be concerned in the
Omofaga," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">She started; the Baron told her what he had told
Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"He will soon resign his place on the Board, you
will see," he ended.</p>

<p class="indent">She sat silent.</p>

<p class="indent">"He will have nothing more to do with it, you
will see;" and, turning to her, he asked with a sudden
spurt of vigour, "Do you know why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"How should I?" she answered steadily.</p>

<p class="indent">"And I&mdash;I have done my part too. I have left
him some money (she knew that the Baron did not
mean her husband) and all the shares I held."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ve done that?" she cried, with a sudden
light in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"You do not want to know why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I know you admired him. You told me so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, that in part. I did admire him. He was
what I have never been. I wish he was here now. I
should like to look at that face of his before I die.
But it was not for his sake that I left him the money.
Why, he could get it without me if he needed it!
You don&#39;t ask me why?"</p>

<p class="indent">In his excitement he had painfully pulled himself
higher up on his pillows, and his head was on the
level with hers now. He looked right into her eyes.
She was very pale, but calm and self-controlled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know," she said. "Why have you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It will make him independent of your husband,"
said the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison dropped her eyes and raised them
again in a swift, questioning glance.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and of you. He need not look to you now."</p>

<p class="indent">He paused and added, slowly, punctuating every
word,</p>

<p class="indent">"You will not be necessary to him now."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison met his gaze full and straight; the
Baron stretched out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, forgive me!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is nothing to forgive," said she.</p>

<p class="indent">"I saw; I knew; I have felt it. Now he will go
away; he will not lean on you now. I have set him
where he can stand alone."</p>

<p class="indent">A smile, half scornful and half sad, came on her
face.</p>

<p class="indent">"You hate me," said the Baron. "But I am right."</p>

<p class="indent">"I was&mdash;we were never necessary to him," said
she. "Ah, Baron, this is no news you give me. I
know him better than that."</p>

<p class="indent">He raised himself higher still, panting as he rested
on his elbow. His head craned forward towards her
as he whispered,</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m a dying man. You can tell me."</p>

<p class="indent">"If you were a dead man&mdash;&mdash;" she burst out passionately.
Then she suddenly recovered herself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"My dear Baron," she went on, "I&#39;m very glad you&#39;ve
done this for Mr. Ruston."</p>

<p class="indent">He sank down on his pillows with a weary sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let him alone, let him alone," he moaned. "You
thought yourself strong."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose you mean kindly," she said, speaking
very coldly. "Indeed, that you should think of me
at all just now shows it. But, Baron, you are disquieting
yourself without cause."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m an old man, and a sick man," he pleaded,
"and you, my dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, suppose I have been&mdash;whatever you like&mdash;indiscreet?
Well&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">She paused, for he made a feebly impatient gesture.
Mrs. Dennison kept silence for a moment;
then in a low tone she said,</p>

<p class="indent">"Baron, why do you speak to a woman about such
things, unless you want her to lie to you?"</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron, after a moment, gave his answer, that
was no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"He is gone," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, he is gone&mdash;to look after his railway."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is finished then?" he half asked, half implored,
and just caught her low-toned reply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Finished? Who for?" Then she suddenly
raised her voice, crying, "What is it to you? Why
can&#39;t I be let alone? How dare you make me talk
about it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I have done," said he, and, laying his thin yellow
hand in hers, he went on, "If you meet him again&mdash;and
I think you will&mdash;tell him that I longed to see
him, as a man who is dying longs for his son. He
would be a breath of life to me in this room, where
everything seems dead. He is full of life&mdash;full as a
tiger. And you can tell him&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped a
moment and smiled. "You can tell him why I was
a buyer of Omofagas. What will he say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What will he say?" she echoed, with wide-opened
eyes, that watched the old man&#39;s slow-moving
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will he weep?" asked the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">"In God&#39;s name, don&#39;t!" she stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">"He will say, &#39;Behold, the Baron von Geltschmidt
was a good man&mdash;he was of use in the world&mdash;may he
sleep in peace!&#39; And now&mdash;how goes the railway?"</p>

<p class="indent">The old man lay silent, with a grim smile on his
face. The woman sat by, with lips set tight in an
agony of repression. At last she spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I&#39;d known you were going to tell me this, I
wouldn&#39;t have come."</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s hard, hard, hard, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, not that. But&mdash;I knew it."</p>

<p class="indent">She rose to her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye," said the Baron. "I shan&#39;t see you
again. God make it light for you, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">She would not seem to hear him. She smoothed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
his pillows and his scanty straggling hair; then she
kissed his forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye," she said. "I will tell Willie when I
see him. I shall see him soon."</p>

<p class="indent">The old man moaned softly and miserably.</p>

<p class="indent">"It would be better if you lay here," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I suppose so," she answered, almost listlessly.
"Good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly he detained her, catching her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you believe in people meeting again anywhere?"
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I suppose so. No, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m sure."</p>

<p class="indent">"They&#39;ve been telling me to have a priest. I call
myself a Catholic, you know. What can I say to a
priest? I have done nothing but make money. If
that is a sin, it&#39;s too simple to need confession, and
I&#39;ve done too much of it for absolution. How can I
talk to a priest? I shall have no priest."</p>

<p class="indent">She did not speak, but let him hold her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"If," he went on, with a little smile, "I&#39;m asked
anywhere what I&#39;ve done, I must say, &#39;I&#39;ve made
money.&#39; That&#39;s all I shall have to say."</p>

<p class="indent">She stooped low over him and whispered,</p>

<p class="indent">"You can say one more thing, Baron&mdash;one little
thing. You once tried to save a woman," and she
kissed him again and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside the house, she found Semingham waiting
for her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I say, Mrs. Dennison," he cried, "Harry&#39;s
come. He got away a day earlier than he expected.
I met him driving up towards your house."</p>

<p class="indent">For just a moment she stood aghast. It came
upon her with a shock; between a respite of a day
and the actual terrible now, there had seemed a gulf.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is he there&mdash;at the house&mdash;now?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Semingham nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you walk up with me?" she asked eagerly.
"I must go directly, you know. He&#39;ll be so sorry not
to find me there. Do you mind coming? I&#39;m tired."</p>

<p class="indent">He offered his arm, and she almost clutched at it,
but she walked with nervous quickness.</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;s looking very well," said Semingham. "A
bit fagged, and so on, you know, of course, but he&#39;ll
soon get all right here."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yes, very soon," she replied absently, quickening
her pace till he had to force his to match it.
But, half-way up the hill, she stopped suddenly,
breathing rapidly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, take a rest, we&#39;ve been bucketing," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did he ask after me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; directly."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you said&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, that you were all right, Mrs. Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks. Has he seen Mr. Loring?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; but he knew he had come here. He told
me so."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I needn&#39;t take you right up, need I?"</p>

<p class="indent">Semingham thought of some jest about not intruding
on the sacred scene, but the jest did not
come. Somehow he shrank from it. Mrs. Dennison
did not.</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall want to fall on one another&#39;s necks,"
said she, smiling. "And you&#39;d feel in the way. You
hate honest emotions, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded, lifted his hat, and turned. On his
way down alone, he stopped once for a moment and
exclaimed,</p>

<p class="indent">"Good heavens! And I believe she&#39;d rather meet
the devil himself. She is a woman!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison pursued her way at a gentler pace.
Before she came in sight, she heard her children&#39;s delighted
chatterings, and, a moment later, Harry&#39;s
hearty tones. His voice brought to her, in fullest
force, the thing that was always with her&mdash;with her as
the cloak that a man hath upon him, and as the girdle
that he is always girded withal.</p>

<p class="indent">When the children saw her, they ran to her, seizing
her hands and dragging her towards Harry. A
little way off stood Marjory Valentine, with a nervous
smile on her lips. Harry himself stood waiting, and
Mrs. Dennison walked up to him and kissed him.
Not till that was done did she speak or look him in
the face. He returned her kiss, and then, talking
rapidly, she made him sit down, and sat herself, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
took her little boy on her knee. And she called Marjory,
telling her jokingly that she was one of the
family.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry began to talk of his journey, and they all
joined in. Then he grew silent, and the children
chattered more about the delights of Dieppe, and how
all would be perfect now that father was come. And,
under cover of their chatter, Maggie Dennison stole a
long covert glance at her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">"And Tom&#39;s here, father," cried the little boy on
her lap exultingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," chimed in Madge, "and Mr. Ruston&#39;s
gone."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a momentary pause; then Mrs. Dennison,
in her calmest voice, began to tell her husband of
the sickness of the Baron. And over Harry Dennison&#39;s
face there rested a new look, and she felt it on
her as she talked of the Baron. She had seen him
before unsatisfied, puzzled, and bewildered by her, but
never before with this look on his face. It seemed to
her half entreaty and half suspicion. It was plain for
everyone to see. He kept his eyes on her, and she
knew that Marjory must be reading him as she read
him. And under that look she went on talking about
the Baron. The look did not frighten her. She did
not fear his suspicions, for she believed he would still
take her word against all the world&mdash;ay, against the
plainest proof. But she almost broke under the burden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
of it; it made her heart sick with pity for him.
She longed to cry out, then and there, "It isn&#39;t true,
Harry, my poor dear, it isn&#39;t true." She could tell
him that&mdash;it would not be all a lie. And when the
children went away to prepare for lunch, she did much
that very thing; for, with a laughing glance of apology
at Marjory, she sat on her husband&#39;s knee and
kissed him twice on either check, whispering,</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve come, Harry."</p>

<p class="indent">And he caught her to him with sudden violence&mdash;unlike
his usual manner, and looked into her eyes and
kissed her. Then they rose, and he turned towards
the house.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Marjory and Mrs. Dennison were
alone together. Mrs. Dennison spoke in a loud clear
voice&mdash;a voice her husband must hear.</p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;re shamefully foolish, aren&#39;t we, Marjory?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl made no answer, but, as she looked at
Maggie Dennison, she burst into a sudden convulsive
sob.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush, hush," whispered Maggie eagerly. "My
God! if I can, you can!"</p>

<p class="indent">So they went in and joined the children at their
merry noisy meal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>A JOINT IN HIS ARMOUR.</h3>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston slept, on the night following his
return to London, in the Carlins&#39; house at Hampstead.
The all-important question of the railway
made a consultation necessary, and Ruston&#39;s indisposition
to face his solitary rooms caused him to accept
gladly the proffered hospitality. The little cramped
place was always a refuge and a rest; there he could
best rejoice over a victory or forget a temporary
defeat. There he fled now, in the turmoil of his
mind. The question of the railway had hurried him
from Dieppe, but it could not carry away from him
the memories of Dieppe. Yet that was the office he
had already begun to ask of it&mdash;of it and of the quiet
busy life at Hampstead, where he lingered till a week
stretched to two and to three, spending his days at
work in the City, and his evenings, after his romp
with the children, in earnest and eager talk and
speculation. He regretted bitterly his going to Dieppe.
He had done what he condemned; he had raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
up a perpetual reproach and a possible danger. He
was not a man who could dismiss such a thing with a
laugh or a sneer, with a pang of penitence and a
swift reaction to the low levels of morality, with a
regret for imprudence and a prayer against consequences.
His nature was too deep, and the influence
he had met too strong, for any of these to be enough.
Yet he had suffered the question of the railway to
drag him away at a moment&#39;s notice; and he was
persuaded that he must take his leaving as setting an
end to all that had passed. All that must be put
behind; forgetfulness in thought might be a relief
impossible to attain, a relief that he would be ashamed
of striving to attain; but forgetfulness in act seemed a
duty to be done. In his undeviating reference of everything
to his own work in life and his neglect of any
other touchstone, he erected into an obligation what
to another would have been a shameless matter of
course; or, again, to yet another, a source of shame-faced
relief. His sins were sin first against himself,
in the second degree only against the participant in
them; his preoccupation with their first quality went
far to blind him to the second.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet he was very sorry for Maggie Dennison. Nay,
those words were ludicrously feeble for the meaning
he wanted from them. Acutely conscious of having
done her a wrong, he was vaguely aware that he
might underestimate the wrong, and remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
uneasily how she had told him that he did not understand,
and despaired because he could not understand.
He felt more for her now&mdash;much more, it seemed to
him; but the consciousness of failure to put himself
where she stood dogged him, making him afraid
sometimes that he could not realise her sufferings,
sometimes that he was imputing to her fictitious tortures
and a sense of ignominy which was not her own.
Searching light, he began to talk to Carlin in general
terms, of course, and by way of chance discourse; and
he ran up against a curious stratum of Puritanism
imbedded amongst the man&#39;s elastic principles. The
narrowest and harshest judgment of an erring woman
accompanied the supple trader and witnessed the surviving
barbarian in Mr. Carlin; an accidental distant
allusion displayed an equally relentless attitude in his
meek hard-working little wife. Willie Ruston drew
in his feelers, and, aghast at the evil these opinions
stamped as the product of his acts, declared for a
moment that his life must be the only and insufficient
atonement. The moment was a brief one. He dismissed
the opinions with a curse, their authors with a
smile, and did not scorn to take for comfort even
Maggie Dennison&#39;s own enthusiasm for his work.
That had drawn them together; that must rule and
limit the connection which it had created. An end&mdash;a
bound&mdash;a peremptory stop (there was still time to
stop) was the thing. She would see that, as he saw it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
God knew (he said to himself) what a wrench it was&mdash;for
she meant more to him than he had ever conceived
a woman could mean; but the wrench must
be undergone. He would rather die than wreck his
work; and she, he knew, rather die than prove a
wrecking siren to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, across the desponding stubbornness of
his resolves, flashed, with a bright white light, the
news of the Baron&#39;s legacy, accompanying, but, after
a hasty regretful thought and a kindly regretful smile,
obliterating the fact of the Baron&#39;s death. Half the
steps upward, he felt, which he had set himself painfully
and with impatient labour to cut, were hewn
deep and smooth for his feet; he had now but to
tread, and lift his foot and tread again. From a paid
servant of his Company, powerful only by a secret
influence unbased on any substantial foundation, he
leapt to the position of a shareholder with a larger
stake than any man besides; no intrigue could shake
him now, no sudden gust of petulant impatience at
the tardiness of results displace him. He had never
thought of this motive behind the Baron&#39;s large purchases
of Omofaga shares; as he thought of it, he had
not been himself had he not smiled. And his smile
was of the same quality as had burst on his face when
first Maggie Dennison dropped the veil and owned
his sway.</p>

<p class="indent">One day he did not go down to the city, but spent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
his time wandering on the heath, mapping out what
he would do in the fast-approaching days in Omofaga.
The prospects were clearing; he had had two interviews
with Lord Detchmore, and the Minister had
fallen back from his own objections on to the scruples
of his colleagues. It was a promising sign, and Willie
was pressing his advantage. The fall in the shares
had been checked; Tom Loring wrote no more; and
Mrs. Carlin had forgotten to mourn the extinct coal
business. He came home, with a buoyant step, at
four o&#39;clock, to find Carlin awaiting him with dismayed
face. There was the worst of news from
Queen Street. Mr. Dennison had written announcing
resignation of his place on the Board.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s a staggering blow," said Carlin, thrusting his
hands into his pockets. "Can&#39;t you bring him round?
Why is he doing it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what does he say?" asked Ruston, a frown
on his brow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, some nonsense&mdash;pressure of other business
or something of that kind. Can&#39;t you go and see
him, Willie? He&#39;s back in town. He writes from
Curzon Street."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know why he does it," said Ruston slowly.
"I knew he&#39;d been selling out."</p>

<p class="indent">"He hasn&#39;t made money at that."</p>

<p class="indent">"No. I&#39;ve made the profit there," said Ruston,
with a sudden smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"The Baron bought &#39;em, eh?" laughed Carlin.
"You generally come out right side up, Willie. You&#39;ll
go and see him, though, won&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Yes. He would go. That was the resolution
which in a moment he reached. If there were danger,
he must face it, if there were calamity, he must
know it. He would go and see Harry Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">As he was, on the stroke of half-past four, he
jumped into a hansom-cab, and bade the man drive to
Curzon Street.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry was not at home&mdash;nor Mrs. Dennison, added
the servant. But both were expected soon.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll wait," said Willie, and he was shown up into
the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">As the servant opened the door, he said in his low
respectful tones,</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Cormack is here, sir, waiting for Mrs. Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later Willie Ruston was overwhelmed
in a shrilly enthusiastic greeting. Mrs. Cormack had
been in despair from <i>ennui</i>; Maggie&#39;s delay was endless,
and Mr. Ruston was in verity a godsend. Indeed
there was every appearance of sincerity in the lady&#39;s
welcome. She stood and looked at him with an expression
of most wicked and mischievous pleasure.
The remorse detected by Tom Loring was not visible
now; pure delight reigned supreme, and gave free
scope to her frivolous fearlessness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Enfin!</i>" she said. "Behold the villain of the
piece!"</p>

<p class="indent">He opened his eyes in questioning.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you think to deceive me too? Why, I have
prophesied it."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are," said Willie, standing on the hearth-rug,
and gazing at her nervous restless figure, so rich
in half-expressed hints too subtle for language, "the
most outrageous of women, Mrs. Cormack. Fortunately
you have a fling at everybody, and the saints
come off as badly as the sinners."</p>

<p class="indent">A shrug asserted her opinion of his pretences. He
answered,</p>

<p class="indent">"I really am so unfortunate as not to have the
least idea what you&#39;re driving at."</p>

<p class="indent">An inarticulate scornful little sound greeted this
protest.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well, I shall wait till you say something," remarked
Willie, with a laugh. "I can&#39;t deny villainies
wholesale, and I can&#39;t argue against Gallic ejaculations."</p>

<p class="indent">"You still come here?" she asked, ignoring his
rudeness, and coming to close quarters with native
audacity.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her for a moment, and then walked
up to her chair, and stood over her. She leant back,
gazing up at him with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here! Don&#39;t talk nonsense," he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
brusquely; "even such talk as yours may do harm
with fools."</p>

<p class="indent">"Fools!" she echoed. "You mean&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"More than half the world," he interrupted.</p>

<p class="indent">"Including&mdash;&mdash;?" she began again in mockery.</p>

<p class="indent">"Some of our acquaintance," he answered, with
the glimmer of a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, I thought you were angry!" she cried,
pointing at the smile on his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall be, if you don&#39;t hold your tongue."</p>

<p class="indent">"You beg me to be silent, Mr. Ruston?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I desire you not to chatter about me, Mrs. Cormack."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, what politeness! I shall say what I please,"
and she rose and stood facing him defiantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish," he said, "that I could tell you what
they do to gossiping women in Omofaga. It is so very
disagreeable&mdash;and appropriate."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I don&#39;t mind hearing."</p>

<p class="indent">"I can believe it, but I mind saying."</p>

<p class="indent">She flushed, and her breath came more quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No doubt you will enforce the treatment&mdash;in
your own interest," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"You won&#39;t be there," replied he, with affected
regret.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, here I shall say what I please."</p>

<p class="indent">"And who will listen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"One man, at least," she cried, in incautious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
anger. "Ah, you&#39;d like to beat me, wouldn&#39;t
you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why suggest the impossible?" he asked, smiling.
"I can&#39;t beat every&mdash;&mdash;" he paused, and added
with deliberateness, "every vulgar-minded woman in
London;" and turning his back on her, he sat down
and took up a newspaper that lay on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">For full five or six minutes Mrs. Cormack sat
silent. Willie Ruston glanced through the leading
article, and turned the paper, folding it neatly. There
was a letter from a correspondent on the subject of
the watersheds of Central South Africa, and he was
reading it with attention. He thought that he recognised
Tom Loring&#39;s hand. The watersheds of Omofaga
were not given their due. Ah, and here was that
old falsehood about arid wastes round Fort Imperial!</p>

<p class="indent">"By Jove, it&#39;s too bad!" he exclaimed aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cormack, who had for the last few moments
been watching him, first with a frown, then with a
half-incredulous, half-amazed smile, burst out into
laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Really, one might as well be offended with a
grizzly bear!" she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">He put down the paper, and met her gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">"How in the world," she went on, "does she&mdash;there,
I beg your pardon. How does anyone endure
you, Mr. Ruston?"</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, before he could answer, the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
opened, and Harry Dennison came in. He entered
with a hesitating step. After greeting Mrs. Cormack,
he advanced towards Ruston. The latter held out his
hand, and Harry took it. He did not look Ruston in
the eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"How are you?" said he. "You want to see
me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, for a moment, if you can spare the time&mdash;on
business."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it about my letter to Carlin?"</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston nodded. Mrs. Cormack kept a close watch.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I can&#39;t alter that," said Harry, in a confused
way. "Sir George is so crippled now, so much of the
work falls on me; I have really no time."</p>

<p class="indent">"You might have left us your name."</p>

<p class="indent">"I couldn&#39;t do that, could I? Suppose you came
to grief?" and he laughed uncomfortably.</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston was afflicted by a sense of weakness&mdash;a
vulnerability new in his experience&mdash;forbidding
him to be urgent with the renegade. Had Carlin been
present, he would have stood astounded at his chief&#39;s
tonguetiedness. Mrs. Cormack smiled at it, and her
smile, caught in a swift glance by Ruston, spurred him
to a voluble appeal, that sounded to himself hollow
and ineffective. It had no effect on Harry Dennison,
who said little, but shook his head with unfailing resolution.
Mrs. Cormack could not resist the temptation
to offer matters an opportunity of development.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"But what does Maggie say to your desertion?"
she asked in an innocently playful way.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry seemed nonplussed at the question, and Willie
Ruston interposed.</p>

<p class="indent">"We needn&#39;t bring Mrs. Dennison into it," he said,
smiling. "It&#39;s a matter of business, and if Dennison
has made up his mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He ended with a shrug, and took up his hat.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I think so, Ruston," stumbled Harry.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where is Maggie?" asked Mrs. Cormack curiously.
"They told me she would be in soon."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know," said Harry. "She went out driving.
She&#39;s sometimes late in coming back."</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston was shaking hands with Mrs. Cormack,
and, when he walked out, Harry followed him. The
two men went downstairs in silence. Harry opened
the front door. Willie Ruston held out his hand,
but Harry did not this time take it. Holding the
door-knob, he looked at his visitor with a puzzled
entreaty in his eyes, and his visitor suddenly felt sorry
for him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope Mrs. Dennison is well?" said Ruston,
after a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," answered Harry, with rough abruptness.
"She&#39;s not well. I knew how it would be; I told you.
You would go."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You would talk to her about your miserable Company&mdash;our Company,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
if you like. I knew it would do
her harm. I told you so."</p>

<p class="indent">He was pouring out his incoherent charges and
repetitions in a fretful petulance.</p>

<p class="indent">"The doctor says her nerves are all wrong; she
must be left alone. I see it. She&#39;s not herself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then that," said Ruston, "is the real reason why
you&#39;re severing yourself from us?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t want her to hear anything more about it;
she got absorbed in it. I told you she would, but you
wouldn&#39;t listen. Tom Loring thought just the same.
But you would go."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is she ill?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I don&#39;t know that she&#39;s ill. She&#39;s&mdash;she&#39;s not
herself. She&#39;s strange."</p>

<p class="indent">The note of distress in his voice grew more acute
as he went on.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m very sorry," said Willie, baldly. "Give her
my best&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you want to see me again about it, I&mdash;you&#39;ll
always know where to find me in the City, won&#39;t you?"
He shuffled his feet nervously, and twisted the door-knob
as he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean," asked Ruston, slowly, "that I&#39;d better
not come here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, yes&mdash;just now," mumbled Harry; and he
added apologetically, "She&#39;s seeing very few people
just now, you know."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"As you please, of course," said Ruston, shortly.
"I daresay you&#39;re right. I should like to say, Dennison,
that I did not intend&mdash;&mdash;." He suddenly stopped
short. There was no need to rush unbidden into more
falseness. "Good-bye," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry took the offered hand in a limp grasp, but
his eyes did not leave the ground. A moment later the
door closed, and Ruston was alone outside&mdash;knowing
that he had been turned out&mdash;in however ineffective
blundering manner, yet, in fact, turned out&mdash;and by
Harry Dennison. That Harry knew nothing, he hardly
felt as a comfort; that perhaps he suspected hardly
as a danger. He was angry and humiliated that such
a thing should happen, and that he should be powerless
to prevent, and without title to resent, the blow.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking up he caught sight dimly in the dim light
of a lithe figure and a mocking face. Mrs. Cormack
had regained her own house by means of the little
gate, and stood leaning over the balcony smiling at
him like some disguised fiend in a ballet or opera-bouffe.
He heard a tinkling laugh. Had she listened?
She was capable of it, and if she had, it
might well be that she had caught a word or two.
But perhaps his air and attitude were enough to tell
the tale. She craned her neck over the parapet, and
called to him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope we shall see you soon again. Of course,
you&#39;ll be coming to see Maggie soon?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, soon, I hope," he answered sturdily, and the
low tinkle of laughter rang out again in answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Without more, he turned on his heel and walked
down the street, a morose frown on his brow.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been gone some half-hour when, just
before eight o&#39;clock, Mrs. Dennison&#39;s victoria drove
quickly up to the door. The evening was chilly and
she was wearing her furs. Her face rose pale and
rigid above them; and as she walked to the house,
her steps dragged as though in weariness. She did
not go upstairs, but knocked, almost timidly, at the
door of her husband&#39;s study. Entering in obedience
to his call, she found him sitting in his deep leathern
arm-chair by the fire. She leant her arm on the back
and stared over his head into the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">"Anyone been, Harry?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">He lifted his eyes with a start.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it you, Maggie?" he cried, leaping up and
seizing her hand. "Why, how cold you are, dear!
Come and sit by the fire."</p>

<p class="indent">She did as he bade her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Any visitors?" she asked again.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ruston," he answered, turning and poking the
fire as he did so. "He came to see me about the
Company, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is he long gone?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, some time."</p>

<p class="indent">"He was angry, was he?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Maggie. But I stuck to it. I won&#39;t have
anything more to do with the thing."</p>

<p class="indent">His petulance betrayed itself again in his voice.
She said nothing, and, after a moment, he asked anxiously,</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mind much? You know the doctor&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, the doctor! No, Harry, I don&#39;t mind. Do
as you like. He can get on without us."</p>

<p class="indent">"If you really mind, I&#39;ll try&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no, no," she burst out. "You&#39;re quite right.
Of course you&#39;re right. I don&#39;t want you to go on.
I&#39;m tired of it too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you?" he asked, with a face suddenly brightening.
"Are you really? Then I&#39;m glad I told
Ruston not to come bothering about it here."</p>

<p class="indent">Had he been listening, he could have heard the
sharp indrawing of her breath.</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, I told him not to come and see you till&mdash;till
you were stronger."</p>

<p class="indent">She shot a terrified glance at him. His expression
was merely anxious and, according to its wont when
he was in a difficulty, apologetic.</p>

<p class="indent">"And he won&#39;t be here much longer now," he
added, comfortingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, not much," she forced herself to murmur.</p>

<p class="indent">"Won&#39;t you go and dress for dinner?" he asked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
after a moment. "It&#39;s ordered for a quarter-past, and
it&#39;s more than that now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it? I&#39;ll come directly. You go, and I&#39;ll
follow you. I shan&#39;t be long."</p>

<p class="indent">He came near to where she sat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you feeling better?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Harry, Harry, I&#39;m well, perfectly well!
You and your doctor!" and she broke into an impatient
laugh. "You&#39;ll persuade me into the grave
before you&#39;ve done."</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her for a moment, and then, shaping
his lips to whistle, sounded a few dreary notes and
stole out of the room.</p>

<p class="indent">She heard the door close, and, sitting up, stretched
her arms over her head. Then she sighed for relief
at his going. It was much to be alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>A TOAST IN CHAMPAGNE.</h3>

<p class="indent">"A month to-day!" said Lady Valentine, pausing
in her writing (she had just set "Octr. 10th" at the
head of her paper) and gazing sorrowfully across the
room at Marjory.</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory knew well what she meant. The poor
woman was counting the days that still lay between
her and the departure of her son.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now don&#39;t, mother," protested Marjory.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I know I&#39;m silly. I met Mr. Ruston at the
Seminghams&#39; yesterday, and he told me that there
wasn&#39;t the least danger, and that it was a glorious
chance for Walter&mdash;just what you said from the first,
dear&mdash;and that Walter could run over and see me in
about eighteen months&#39; time. Oh, but, Marjory, I
know it&#39;s dangerous!"</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory rose and crossed over to where her mother sat.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must be a Spartan matron, dear," said she.
"You can&#39;t keep Walter in leading strings all his life."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"No; but he might have stayed here, and got on,
and gone into Parliament, and so on." She paused
and added, "Like Evan, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory coloured&mdash;more from self-reproach than
embarrassment. She had gone in these last weeks
terribly near to forgetting poor Evan&#39;s existence.</p>

<p class="indent">"Evan came in while I was at the Seminghams&#39;.
He looked so dull, poor fellow. I&mdash;I asked him to
dinner, Marjory. He hasn&#39;t been here for a long
while. We haven&#39;t seen nearly as much of him since
we knew Mr. Ruston. I don&#39;t think they like one
another."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know why he hasn&#39;t come here," said Marjory
softly.</p>

<p class="indent">"He spent a week with me while you were at
Dieppe. He seemed to like to hear about you."</p>

<p class="indent">A smile of sad patience appeared on Marjory&#39;s
face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, my dear, you are such a bad hinter," she
half laughed, half moaned.</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor Evan! I&#39;m very sorry for him; but I can&#39;t
help it, can I?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It would have been so nice."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you used to be such a mercenary creature!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, well, my dear, I want to keep one of my
children with me. But, if it can&#39;t be, it can&#39;t."</p>

<p class="indent">Marjory bent down and whispered in her mother&#39;s
ear, "I&#39;m not going to Omofaga, dear."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I used to be half afraid of it," admitted
Lady Valentine (she forgot that she had half hoped it
also); "but you never seem to be interested in him
now. Do you mind Evan coming to dinner?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no," said Marjory.</p>

<p class="indent">Since her return from Dieppe she had seemed to
"mind" nothing. Relaxation of the strain under
which her days passed there had left her numbed.
She was conscious only of a passionate shrinking from
the sight or company of the two people who had there
filled her life. To meet them again forced her back
in thought to that dreary mysterious night with its
unsolved riddle, that she feared seeking to answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Her mother had called on Maggie Dennison, and
came back with a flow of kindly lamentations over
Maggie&#39;s white cheeks and listless weary air. Her
brother was constantly with Ruston, and tried to persuade
her to join parties of which he was to be one.
She fenced with both of them, escaping on one plea
and another; and Maggie&#39;s acquiescence in her absence,
no less than Ruston&#39;s failure to make a chance
of meeting her, strengthened her resolve to remain
aloof.</p>

<p class="indent">Young Sir Walter also came to dinner that night;
he was very gay and chatty, full of Omofaga and his
fast-approaching expedition. He greeted Evan Haselden
with a manner that claimed at least equality; nay,
he lectured him a little on the ignorant interference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
of a stay-at-home House of Commons with the work
of the men on the spot, in South Africa and elsewhere;
people on this side would not give a man a
free hand, he complained, and exhorted Evan to take
no part in such ill-advised meddling.</p>

<p class="indent">Hence he was led on to the topic he was never now
far away from&mdash;Willie Ruston&mdash;and he reproached
his mother and sister for their want of attention to
the hero.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the first gleam of light for poor Evan
Haselden, for it told him that Willie Ruston was not,
as he had feared, a successful rival. He rejoiced at
Lady Valentine&#39;s hinted dislike of Ruston, and anxiously
studied Marjory&#39;s face in hope of detecting a
like disposition. But his vanity led him to return
Walter&#39;s lecture, and he added an innuendo concerning
the unscrupulousness of adventurers who cloaked
money-making under specious pretences. Walter
flared up in a moment, and the dinner ended in something
like a dispute between the two young men.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Dennison&#39;s found him out, anyhow," said
Evan bitterly. "He&#39;s cut the whole concern."</p>

<p class="indent">"We can do without Dennison," said young Sir
Walter scornfully.</p>

<p class="indent">When the meal was finished, young Sir Walter,
treating his friend without ceremony, carelessly pleaded
an engagement, and went out. Lady Valentine,
interpreting Evan&#39;s glances, and hoping against hope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
seized the chance of leaving him alone with her
daughter. Marjory watched the man&oelig;uvre without
thwarting it. Her heart was more dead to Evan than
it had ever been. Her experiences at Dieppe had
aged her mind, and she found him less capable of
stirring any feeling in her than even in the days when
she had half made a hero out of Willie Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">She waited for his words in resignation; and he,
acute enough to mark her moods, began as a man begins
who rushes on anticipated defeat. What is
unintelligible seems most irresistible, and he knew not at
what point to attack her indifference. He saw the
change in her; he could have dated its beginning.
The cause he found somehow in Ruston, but yet it
was clear to him that she did not think of Ruston as
a suitor&mdash;almost clear that she heard his name and
thought of him with repulsion&mdash;and that the attraction
he had once exercised over her was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">The weary talk wore to its close, ending with angry
petulance on his side, and, at last, on hers with a
grief that was half anger. He could not believe in
her decision, unless there were one who had displaced
him; and, seeing none save Ruston, in spite of his
own convictions, he broke at last into a demand to be
told whether she thought of him. Marjory started in
horror, crying, "No, no," and, for all Evan&#39;s preoccupation,
her vehemence amazed him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you&#39;ve found him out too, perhaps," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
sneered. "You&#39;ve found him out by now. All the
same, it was his fault that you didn&#39;t care for me before."</p>

<p class="indent">"Evan," she implored, "do, pray, not talk like
that. There&#39;s not a man in the whole world that I
would not have for my husband rather than him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Now," he repeated; "but I&#39;m speaking of before."</p>

<p class="indent">Half angry again at that he should allow himself
such an insinuation, she yet liked him too well, and
felt too unhappy to be insincere.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," she said with a troubled smile, "if you
like, I&#39;ve found him out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, Marjory," cried Evan, in a spasm of reviving
hope, "if that fellow&#39;s out of the way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">But she would not hear him, and he flung himself
out of the house with a rudeness that his love pardoned.</p>

<p class="indent">She heard him go, in aching sorrow that he, who
felt few things deeply, should feel this one so deeply.
Then, following the calls of society, which are followed
in spite of most troubles, she, pale-faced and sad, and
her mother, almost weeping in motherly distress,
dressed themselves to go to a party. Lady Semingham
was at home that night.</p>

<p class="indent">At the party all was gay and bright. Lady Semingham
was chattering to Mr. Otto Heather. Semingham
was trying to make Mr. Foster Belford understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
the story of the Baron and Willie Ruston, Lord
Detchmore, who had come in from a public dinner,
was conspicuous in his blue riband, and was listening
to Adela Ferrars with a smile on his face. Marjory
sat down in a corner, hoping to escape introductions,
and, when an old friend carried her mother off to eat
an ice, she kept her place. Presently she heard cried,
"Mrs. Dennison," and Maggie came in with her usual
grace. It seemed as though the last few months were
blotted out, and they were all again at that first party
at Mrs. Dennison&#39;s where Willie Ruston had made his
<i>entrée</i>. The illusion was not to lack confirmation, for,
a moment later, Ruston himself was announced, and
the sound of his name made Adela turn her head for
one swift moment from her distinguished companion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" said Lord Detchmore, "then I must go.
If I talk to him any more I&#39;m a lost man."</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s Mr. Loring in the corner&mdash;no, not that
corner; that&#39;s Marjory Valentine. He will take your
side."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why are they all in corners?" asked Detchmore.</p>

<p class="indent">"They don&#39;t want to be trodden on," said Adela,
with a grimace. "You&#39;d better take one too."</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s Mrs. Dennison in a third corner. Shall
I take that one, or should I get trodden on there?"</p>

<p class="indent">Adela looked up swiftly. His remark hinted at
gossip afloat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Take one for yourself," she began, with an uneasy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
laugh. But the laugh suddenly became genuine
for the very absurdity of the thing. "We&#39;ll go and
join Mr. Loring, shall we?" she proposed.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Detchmore acquiesced, and they walked over
to where Tom stood. On their way, to their consternation,
they encountered Willie Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now we&#39;re in for it," breathed Detchmore in low
tones. But Ruston, with a bow, passed on, going
straight as an arrow towards where Maggie Dennison
sat. Lord Detchmore raised his eyebrows, Adela shut
her fan with a click, Tom Loring, when they reached
him, was frowning. Away across the room sat Marjory
alone.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good heavens! he let me alone!" exclaimed
Lord Detchmore.</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps I was your shield," said Adela. "He
doesn&#39;t like me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nor you, Loring, I expect?"</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Lord Detchmore moved away, leaving
Adela and Tom together. They had been together a
good deal lately, and their tones showed the intimacy
of friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">"That man," said Adela quickly, "suspects something.
He&#39;s a terrible old gossip, although he is a
great statesman, of course. Can&#39;t you prevent them
talking there together?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," said Tom composedly, "I can&#39;t; she&#39;d send
me away if I went."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Then I shall go. Why isn&#39;t Harry here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He wouldn&#39;t come. I&#39;ve been dining with him
at the club."</p>

<p class="indent">"He ought to have come."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t believe it would have made any difference."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela looked at him for a moment; then she
walked swiftly across the room to Maggie Dennison,
and held out her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maggie, I haven&#39;t had a talk with you for ever so
long. How do you do, Mr. Ruston?"</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston shook hands but did not move. He stood
silently through two or three moments of Adela&#39;s
forced chatter. Mrs. Dennison was sitting on a small
couch, which would just hold two people; but she sat
in the middle of it, and did not offer to make room
for Adela. When Adela paused for want of anything
to say, there was silence. She looked from the one to
the other. Ruston smiled the smile that always
exasperated her on his face&mdash;the smile of possession
she called it in an attempt at definition.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look at Marjory!" said Mrs. Dennison. "How
solitary she looks! Poor girl! Do go and talk to
her, Adela."</p>

<p class="indent">"I came to talk to you," said Adela, in fiery temper.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;ll come and talk to you both directly,"
said Maggie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"We&#39;re talking business," added Willie Ruston,
still smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, if you don&#39;t want me!" cried Adela, and she
turned away, declaring in her heart that she had made
the last effort of friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">With her going went Ruston&#39;s smile. He bent his
head, and said in a low voice,</p>

<p class="indent">"You are the only woman whom I could have left
like that, and the only one whom I could have found
it hard to leave. Was it very hard for you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It was just the truth for me," she answered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course you were angry and hurt. I was afraid
you would be," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him with a curious smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"But then," he continued, "you saw how I was
placed. Do you think I didn&#39;t suffer in going? I&#39;ve
never had such a wrench in my life. Won&#39;t you forgive
me, Maggie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Forgive! What&#39;s the use of talking like that?
What&#39;s the use of my &#39;forgiving&#39; you for being what
you are?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You talk as if you&#39;d found me out in something."</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to him, saying very low,</p>

<p class="indent">"And haven&#39;t you found me out, too? We are
face to face now, Willie."</p>

<p class="indent">He did not fully understand her. Half in justification,
half in apology, he said doggedly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I simply had to go."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, you simply had to go. There was the railway.
Oh, what&#39;s the use of talking about it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I was afraid you meant to have nothing more to
do with me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Or you wished it?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">He started. She had discerned the thoughts that
came into his mind in his solitary walks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t be afraid. I&#39;ve wished it," she added.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause; then he, not denying her
charge, whispered,</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t wish it now&mdash;not when I&#39;m with you."</p>

<p class="indent">"To have nothing more to do with you! Ah,
Willie, I have nothing to do with anything but you."</p>

<p class="indent">A swift glance from him told her that her appeal
touched him.</p>

<p class="indent">"What else is left me? Can I live as I am living?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What are we to do?" he asked. "We shall see
one another sometimes now. I can&#39;t come to your
house, you know. But sometimes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"At a party&mdash;here and there! And the rest of the
time I must live at&mdash;at home! Home!"</p>

<p class="indent">He bent to her, whispering,</p>

<p class="indent">"We must arrange&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no," she replied, passionately. "Don&#39;t you
see?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" he asked, puzzled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you don&#39;t understand! It&#39;s not that. It&#39;s
not that I can&#39;t live without you."</p>

<p class="indent">"I never said that," he interposed quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">"And yet I suppose it is that. But it&#39;s something
more. Willie, I can&#39;t live with him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Does he suspect?" he asked in an eager whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. I really don&#39;t know. It&#39;s worse
if he doesn&#39;t. Oh, if you knew what I feel when he
looks at me and asks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Asks what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing&mdash;nothing in words; but, Willie, everything,
everything. I shall go mad, if I stay. And then
don&#39;t you see&mdash;&mdash;?" She stopped, going on again a
moment later. "I&#39;ve borne it till I could see you.
But I can&#39;t go on bearing it."</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced at her.</p>

<p class="indent">"We can&#39;t talk about it here," he said. "Everybody
will see how agitated you are."</p>

<p class="indent">For answer she schooled her face to rigidity, and
her hands to motionlessness.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must talk about it&mdash;here and now," she
said. "It&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve seen you since&mdash;Dieppe.
What are you going to do, Willie?"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked round. Then, with a smile, he offered
his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must take you to have something," he said.
"Come, we must walk through the room."</p>

<p class="indent">She rose and took his arm. Bowing and smiling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
she turned to greet her acquaintances. She stopped
to speak to Lord Detchmore, and exchanged a word
with her host.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. What are you going to do?" she asked
again, aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">They had reached the room where the <i>buffet</i> stood.
Mrs. Dennison, after a few words to Lady Valentine,
who was still there, sat down on a chair a little remote
from the crowd. Ruston brought her a cup of coffee,
and stood in front of her, with the half-conscious intention
of shielding her from notice. She drank the
coffee hastily; its heat brought a slight glow to her
face.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re going as you planned?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">He answered in low, dry tones, emptied of all emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said he, "I&#39;m going."</p>

<p class="indent">She stretched out her hand towards him imploringly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Willie, you must take me with you," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked down with startled face.</p>

<p class="indent">"My God, Maggie!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t stay here. I can&#39;t stay with him."</p>

<p class="indent">Her lips quivered; he took her cup from her (he
feared that she would let it fall), and set it on the table.
Behind them he heard merry voices; Semingham&#39;s
was loud among them. The voices were coming
near them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"I must think," he whispered. "We can&#39;t talk
now. I must see you again."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where?" she asked helplessly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Carlin&#39;s. Come up to-morrow. I can arrange
it. For heaven&#39;s sake, begin to talk about something."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I could stand here and tell it to the room," she
said, "sooner than live as I live now."</p>

<p class="indent">He had no time to answer. Semingham&#39;s arm was
on his shoulder. Lord Detchmore stood by his side.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want," said Semingham, "to introduce Lord
Detchmore to you, Mrs. Dennison. It&#39;s not at all disinterested
of me. You must persuade him&mdash;you
know what about."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no," laughed the Minister, "I mustn&#39;t be
talked to; it&#39;s highly improper, and I distrust my
virtue."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;ll be bound now that you were talking about
Omofaga this very minute," pursued Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course we were," said Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re a great enthusiast, Mrs. Dennison,"
smiled Detchmore. "You ought to go out, you
know. Can&#39;t you persuade your husband to lend you
to the expedition?"</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston could have killed the man for his <i>malapropos</i>
jesting. Maggie Dennison seemed unable to
answer it. Semingham broke in lightly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"It would be a fine chance for proving the quality&mdash;and
the equality&mdash;of women," said he. "I always
told Mrs. Dennison that she ought to be Queen
of Omofaga."</p>

<p class="indent">"And I hope," said Detchmore, with a significant
smile, "that there&#39;ll soon be a railway to take you
there."</p>

<p class="indent">Even at that moment, the light of triumph came
suddenly gleaming into Ruston&#39;s eyes. He looked at
Detchmore, who laughed and nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think so. I think I shall be able to manage
it," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s an end to all our troubles," said Semingham.
"Come, we&#39;ll drink to it."</p>

<p class="indent">He signed to a waiter, who brought champagne.
Lord Detchmore gallantly pressed a glass on Mrs.
Dennison. She shook her head, but took it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Long life to Omofaga, and death to its enemies!"
cried Semingham in burlesque heroics, and,
with a laugh&mdash;that was, as his laughs so often were,
as much at himself as at the rest of the world&mdash;he
made a mock obeisance to Willie Ruston, adding,
"<i>Moriamur pro rege nostro!</i>" and draining the glass.</p>

<p class="indent">Maggie Dennison&#39;s eyes sparkled. Behind the
mockery in Semingham&#39;s jest, behind the only half
make-believe homage which Detchmore&#39;s humorous
glance at Ruston showed, she saw the reality of deference,
the acknowledgment of power in the man she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
loved. For a brief moment she tasted the troubled
joy which she had paid so high to win. For a moment
her eyes rested on Willie Ruston as a woman&#39;s
eyes rest on a man who is the world&#39;s as well as hers,
but also hers as he is not the world&#39;s. She sipped the
champagne, echoing in her low rich voice, so that the
men but just caught the words, "<i>Moriamur pro rege
nostro</i>" and gave the glass into Ruston&#39;s hand.</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden seriousness fell upon them. Detchmore
glanced at Semingham, and thence, curiously, at Willie
Ruston, whose face was pale and marked with a
deep-lined frown. Mrs. Dennison had sunk back in
her chair, and her heart rose and fell in agitated
breathings. Then Willie Ruston spoke in cool deliberate
tones.</p>

<p class="indent">"The King there was a Queen," he said. "You&#39;ve
drunk to the wrong person, Semingham. I&#39;ll drink it
right," and, bowing to Maggie Dennison, he drained
his glass. Looking up, he found Detchmore&#39;s eyes on
him in overpowering wonder.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I tell you a story, Lord Detchmore," said he,
"you&#39;ll understand," and, yielding his place by Maggie
Dennison, he took Detchmore with him, and they
walked away in talk.</p>

<p class="indent">It was an hour later when Lord Detchmore took
leave of his host.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, did you hear the story?" asked Semingham.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; I heard it," said Detchmore, "about the
telegram, wasn&#39;t it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, and of course, you see, it explains the
toast."</p>

<p class="indent">"That sounds like a question, Semingham."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, no. The note of interrogation was&mdash;a printer&#39;s
error."</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s a remarkable story."</p>

<p class="indent">"It really is," said Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"And&mdash;is it the whole story?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, isn&#39;t it enough to justify the toast?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It&mdash;and she&mdash;are enough," said Detchmore.
"But, Semingham&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham, however, took him by the arm,
walked him into the hall, got his hat and coat for
him, helped him on with them, and wished him good-night.
Detchmore submitted without resistance. Just
at the last, however, as he fitted his hat on his head,
he said,</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re unusually explicit, Semingham. He goes
to Omofaga soon, don&#39;t he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, thank God," said Semingham, almost cheerfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>THE CUTTING OF THE KNOT.</h3>

<p class="indent">"You can manage it for me?" asked Willie Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose I can," answered Carlin; "but it&#39;s
rather queer, isn&#39;t it, Willie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s queer or not; but I
must talk to her for half-an-hour."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not at Curzon Street?"</p>

<p class="indent">Ruston laughed a short little laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you really want the reason stated?" he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">Carlin shook his head gloomily, but he attempted
no remonstrance. He confined himself to saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope the deuce you&#39;re not getting yourself into
a mess!"</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;ll be here about five. You must be here,
you know, and you must leave me with her. Look
here, Carlin, I only want a word with her."</p>

<p class="indent">"But my wife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Send your wife somewhere&mdash;to the theatre with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
the children, or somewhere. Mind you&#39;re here to
receive her."</p>

<p class="indent">He issued his orders and walked away. He hated
making arrangements of this sort, but there was (he
told himself) no help for it. Anything was better
than talking to Maggie Dennison before the world in
a drawing-room. And it was for the last time. Removed
from her presence, he felt clear about that.
The knot must be cut; the thing must be finished.
His approaching departure made a natural and inevitable
end to it; and her mad suggestion of coming with
him shewed in its real enormity as he mused on it in
his solitary thoughts. For a moment she had carried
him away. The picture of her pale eloquent face, and
the gleam of her eager eyes had almost led him to
self-betrayal; the idea of her in such a mood beside
him in his work and his triumphs had seemed for the
moment irresistible. She could double his strength
and make joy of his toil. But it could not be so; and
for it to be so, if it could be, he must stand revealed
as a traitor to his friend, and be banned for an outlaw
by his acquaintance. He had been a traitor, of
course, but he need not persist. They&mdash;she and he&mdash;must
not stereotype a passing madness, nor refuse the
rescue chance had given them. There was time to
draw back, to set matters right again&mdash;at least, to
trammel up the consequence of wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">When she came, and Carlin, frowning perplexedly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
had, with awkward excuses, taken himself away, he
said all this to her in stumbling speech. From the
exaltation of the evening before they fell pitiably.
They had soared then in vaulting imagination over
the bristling barriers; to-day they could rise to no
such height. Reality pressed hard upon them, crushing
their romance into crime, their passion to the vulgarity
of an everyday intrigue. This secret backstairs
meeting seemed to stamp all that passed at it with its
own degrading sign; their high-wrought defiance of
the world and the right dwindled before their eyes to
a mean and sly evasiveness. So felt Willie Ruston;
and Maggie Dennison sat silent while he painted for
her what he felt. She did not interrupt him; now
and again a shiver or a quick motion shewed that she
heard him. At last he had said his say, and stood,
leaning against the mantelpiece, looking down on her.
Then, without glancing up, she asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"And what&#39;s to become of me, Willie?"</p>

<p class="indent">The sudden simple question revealed him to himself.
Put in plain English, his rigmarole meant,
"Go your way and I&#39;ll go mine." What he had said
might be right&mdash;might be best&mdash;might be duty&mdash;might
be religion&mdash;might be anything you would. But a
man may forfeit the right to do right.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of you?" he stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t live as I am," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">He began to pace up and down the room. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
sat almost listlessly in her chair. There was an air of
helplessness about her. But she was slowly thinking
over what he had said and realising its purport.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean we&#39;re never to meet again?" she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not that!" he cried, with a sudden heat that
amazed himself. "Not that, Maggie. Why that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why that?" she repeated in wondering tones.
"What else do you mean? You don&#39;t mean we
should go on like this?"</p>

<p class="indent">He did not dare to answer either way. The one
was now impossible&mdash;had swiftly, as he looked at her,
come to seem impossible; the other was to treat her
as not even he could treat her. She was not of the
stuff to live a life like that.</p>

<p class="indent">There was silence while he waged with himself
that strange preposterous struggle, where evil seemed
good, and good a treachery not to be committed;
wherein his brain seemed to invite to meanness, and
his passion, for once, to point the better way.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish to God we had never&mdash;&mdash;" he began; but
her despairing eyes stifled the feeble useless sentence
on his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">At last he came near to her; the lines were deep
on his forehead, and his mouth quivered under a
forced smile. He laid his hand on her shoulder. She
looked up questioningly.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know what you&#39;re asking?" he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span></p>

<p class="indent">She nodded her head.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then so be it," said he; and he went again and
leant against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt that he had paid a debt with his life, but
knew not whether the payment were too high.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to him long before she spoke&mdash;long
enough for him to repeat again to himself what he
had done&mdash;how that he, of all men, had made a burden
that would break his shoulders, and had fettered
his limbs for all his life&#39;s race&mdash;yet to be glad, too,
that he had not shrunk from carrying what he had
made, and had escaped coupling the craven with his
other part.</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?" she asked at last; and
there was surprise in her tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"It shall be as you wish," he answered. "We&#39;ll
go through with it together."</p>

<p class="indent">Though he was giving what she asked, she seemed
hardly to understand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t let you go," he said; "and I suppose you
can&#39;t let me go."</p>

<p class="indent">"But&mdash;but what&#39;ll happen?"</p>

<p class="indent">"God knows," said he. "We shall be a long way
off, anyhow."</p>

<p class="indent">"In Omofaga, Willie?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">After a pause she rose and moved a step towards
him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Why are you doing it?" she asked, searching his
eyes with hers. "Is it just because I ask? Because
you&#39;re sorry for me?"</p>

<p class="indent">She was standing near him, and he looked on her
face. Then he sprang forward, catching her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s because you&#39;re more to me than I ever
thought any woman could be."</p>

<p class="indent">She let her hands lie in his.</p>

<p class="indent">"But you came here," she said, "meaning to send
me away."</p>

<p class="indent">"I was a fool," he said, grimly, between his teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">She drew her hands away, and then whispered,</p>

<p class="indent">"And, Willie&mdash;Harry?"</p>

<p class="indent">Again he had nothing to answer. She stood looking
at him with a wistful longing for a word of comfort.
He gave none. She passed her hand across her
eyes, and burst into sudden sobs.</p>

<p class="indent">"How miserable I am!" she sobbed. "I wish I
was dead!"</p>

<p class="indent">He made as though to take her hand again, but
she shrank, and he fell back. With one hand over
her eyes, she felt her way back to her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">For five minutes or more she sat crying. Ruston
did not move. He had nothing wherewith to console
her, and he dared not touch her. Then she looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I were dead?" she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush! hush! You&#39;d break my heart," he answered
in low tones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span></p>

<p class="indent">In the midst of her weeping, for an instant she
smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, Willie, Willie!" she said; and he knew that
she read him through and through, so that he was
ashamed to protest again.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not believe in that from him.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently her sobs ceased, and she crushed her
handkerchief into a ball in her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Maggie?" said he in hard even tones.</p>

<p class="indent">She rose again to her feet and came to him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Kiss me, Willie," she said; "I&#39;m going back
home."</p>

<p class="indent">He took her in his arms and kissed her. She
released herself, and gazed long in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?" he asked. "You can&#39;t bear it; you
know you can&#39;t. Come with me, Maggie. I don&#39;t
understand you."</p>

<p class="indent">"No; I don&#39;t understand myself. I came here
meaning to go with you. I came here thinking I
could never bear to go back. Ah, you don&#39;t know
what it is to live there now. But I must go back.
Ah, how I hate it!"</p>

<p class="indent">She laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"Think&mdash;if I came with you! Think, Willie!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said, as though it had been wrung from
him, "I know. But come all the same, Maggie," and
with a sudden gust of passion he began to beseech
her, declaring that he could not live without her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"No, no," she cried; "it&#39;s not true, Willie, or
you&#39;re not the man I loved. Go on, dear; go on. I
shall hear about you. I shall watch you."</p>

<p class="indent">"But you&#39;ll be here&mdash;with him," he muttered in
grim anger.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, Willie, are you still&mdash;still jealous? Even
now?"</p>

<p class="indent">A silence fell between them.</p>

<p class="indent">"You shall come," he said at last. "What do I
care for him or the rest of them? I care for nothing
but you."</p>

<p class="indent">"I will not come, Willie. I dare not come. Willie,
in a week&mdash;in a day&mdash;Willie, my dear, in an hour
you will be glad that I would not come."</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, her voice grew louder. The words
sounded like a sentence on him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that why?" he asked, regarding her with
moody eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated before she answered, in bewildered
despair.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. I don&#39;t know. In part it is. And I
daren&#39;t think of Harry. Let me think, Willie, that
it&#39;s a little bit because of Harry and the children. I
know I can&#39;t expect you to believe it, but it is a little,
though it&#39;s more because of you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of me?&mdash;for my sake, do you mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; not altogether for your sake; because of
you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"And, Maggie, if he suspects?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He won&#39;t suspect," she said. "He would take
my word against the world."</p>

<p class="indent">"They suspect&mdash;some of them&mdash;that woman Mrs.
Cormack. And&mdash;does Marjory?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It is nothing. He won&#39;t believe. Marjory will
not say a word."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll persuade him that there was nothing&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; I&#39;ll persuade him," she answered.</p>

<p class="indent">She began to pull a glove on to her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must go," she said. "It&#39;s nearly an hour since
I came."</p>

<p class="indent">He took a step towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">"You won&#39;t come, Maggie?" he urged, and there
was still eagerness in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not again, Willie. I can&#39;t stand it again. Good-bye.
I&#39;ve given you everything, Willie. And you&#39;ll
think of me now and then?"</p>

<p class="indent">He was unmanned. He could not answer her, but
turned towards the wall and covered his face with his
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shan&#39;t think of you like that," she said, a note
of wondering reproach in her voice. "I shall think
of you conquering. I like the hard look that they
blame you for. Well, you&#39;ll have it soon again,
Willie."</p>

<p class="indent">She moved towards the door. He did not turn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
She waited an instant looking at him. A smile was
on her lips, and a tear trickled down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">"It&#39;s like shutting the door on life, Willie," she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">He sprang forward, but she raised her hand to stay
him.</p>

<p class="indent">"No. It is&mdash;settled," said she; and she opened
the door of the room and walked out into the little
entrance-hall.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a wet evening, and the rain pattered on the
roof of the projecting porch. They stood there a moment,
till her cabman, who had taken refuge in the
lee of the garden wall, brought his vehicle up to the
door. They heard a step creak behind them in the
hall, and then recede. Carlin was treading on tip-toe
away.</p>

<p class="indent">Maggie Dennison put out her hand and met Ruston&#39;s.
She pressed his hand with strength more than
her own, and she said, very low,</p>

<p class="indent">"I am dying now&mdash;this way&mdash;for my king, Willie,"
and she stepped out into the rain, and climbed into
the cab.</p>

<p class="indent">"Back to where you brought me from," she called
to the man, and leaning forward, where the cab lamps
caught her face, so that it gleamed like the face of
some marble statue, she looked on Willie Ruston. Her
lips moved, but he heard no word. The wheels turned
and the lamps flashed, and she was carried away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Willie started forward a step or two, then ran to
the gate and, leaning on it, watched the red lights as
they fled away; and long after they were gone, he
stood there, bareheaded, in the drenching rain. He
did not think; he still saw her, still heard her voice,
and watched her broad low brow. She still stood before
him, not the fairest of women, but the woman
who was for him. And the rumble of retreating
wheels sounded again in his ears. She was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">How long he stood he did not know. Presently
he felt an arm passed through his, and he was led
back to the house.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Carlin took him through the hall into his own
little study, where a bright fire blazed, and gave him
brandy, which he drank, and helped him off with his
wet coat, and put a cricketing jacket on him, and
pushed him into an arm-chair, and hunted for a pair
of slippers for him.</p>

<p class="indent">All this while neither spoke; and at last Carlin, his
tasks done, stood and warmed himself at the fire, looking
steadily in front of him, and never at his friend.</p>

<p class="indent">"You dear old fool," said Willie Ruston.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, well, well, you mustn&#39;t take cold. If you
were laid up now, what the deuce would become of
Omofaga?"</p>

<p class="indent">His small, sharp, shrewd eyes blinked as he spoke,
and he glanced at Willie Ruston as he named
Omofaga.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Willie sprang to his feet with an oath.</p>

<p class="indent">"My God!" he cried, "why do you do this for
me? Who&#39;ll do anything for her?"</p>

<p class="indent">Carlin blinked again, keeping his gaze aloof.
Then he held out his hand, and Willie seized it,
saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m&mdash;I&#39;m precious hard hit, old man."</p>

<p class="indent">The other nodded and, as Willie sank back in his
chair, stole quietly out of the room, shutting the door
close behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">Willie Ruston drew his chair nearer the fire, and
spread out his hands to the blaze. And as the heat
warmed his frame, the stupor of his mind passed, and
he saw some of what was true&mdash;a glimpse of his naked
self thrown up against the light of the love that others
found for him. And he turned away his eyes, for it
seemed to him that he could not look long and endure
to live. And he groaned that he had won love and
made for himself so mighty an accuser of debts that
it lay not in him to pay. For even then, while he
cursed himself, and cursed the nature that would not
be changed in him; even while the words of his love
were in his ears, and her presence near with him; even
while life seemed naught for the emptiness her going
made, and himself nothing but longing for her; even
then, behind regret, behind remorse, behind agony,
behind self-contempt and self-disgust, lay hidden, and
deeper hidden as he thrust it down, the knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
that he was glad&mdash;glad that his life was his own
again, to lead and make and shape; wherein to take
and hold, to play and win, to fasten on what was his,
and to beat down his enemies before his face. That
no man could rob him of, and the woman who could
would not. So, as Maggie Dennison had said, in the
passing of an hour he was glad; and in the passing of
a week he had learnt to look in the face of the gladness
which he had and loathed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>THE RETURN OF A FRIEND.</h3>

<p class="indent">About a week later, Tom Loring sat at work in
his rooms. The table was strewn with books of blue
and of less alarming colours. Tom was smoking a
short pipe, and when he paused for a fresh idea, the
smoke welled out of his mouth, aye, and out of his
nose, thick and fast. For a while he wrote busily;
then a dash of his pen proclaimed a finished task, and
he lay back in the luxury of accomplishment. Presently
he pushed back his chair, knocked out his pipe,
refilled it, and stretched himself on the sofa. After
the day&#39;s work came the day&#39;s dream; and the day&#39;s
dream dwelt on the coming of the evening hour, when
Tom was to take tea with Adela Ferrars at half-past
five. When he had an appointment like that, it
coloured his whole day, and made his hard labour
pass lightly. Also it helped him to forget what there
was in his own life and his friends&#39; to trouble him;
and he nursed with quiet patience a love that did not
expect, that hardly hoped for, any issue. As he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
been content to be Harry Dennison&#39;s secretary, so
he seemed satisfied to be an undeclared lover; finding
enough for his modesty in what most men would have
felt only a spur to urge them to press further.</p>

<p class="indent">He was roused by a step on the stair. A moment
later, Harry Dennison burst into the room. Tom had
seen him a few days before, uneasy, troubled, apologetic,
talking of Maggie&#39;s strange indisposition&mdash;she
was terribly out of sorts, he had said, and appeared to
find all company and all talk irksome. He had spoken
with a meek compassion that exasperated Tom&mdash;an
unconsciousness of any hardship laid on him. Tom
sat up, glad to console him for an hour; glad, perhaps,
of any company that would trick an hour into
the past. But to-day Harry&#39;s step was light; there
was a smile on his lips, a gleam of hope in his eyes;
he rushed to Tom, seized his hand, and, before he sat
down or took off his hat, blurted out,</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom, old boy, she wants you to come back."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom started.</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" he cried, "Mrs. Dennison wants&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," Harry went on, "she sent for me to-day,
and told me that she saw how I missed you, and that
she was sorry that she had&mdash;well&mdash;sorry for all the
trouble, you know. Then she said, &#39;I wonder if Tom
(she called you Tom) bears malice. Tell him Omofaga
is quite gone, and I want him to come back, and
if he&#39;ll come here, I&#39;ll go on my knees to him.&#39;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Harry stopped, smiling joyfully at his wonderful
news. Tom wore a doubtful look.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t tell you," said Harry, "what it means to
me. It&#39;s not only your coming, old chap, though,
heaven knows, I&#39;m gladder of that than I&#39;ve been of
anything for months&mdash;but you see what it means,
Tom? It means&mdash;why, it means that we&#39;re to be as
we were before that fellow came. Tom, she spoke to
me more as she used to-day."</p>

<p class="indent">His voice faltered; he spoke as an innocent loyal
man might of a pardon from some loved capricious
Sovereign. He had not understood the disfavour&mdash;he
had dimly discerned inexplicable anger. Now it was
past, and the sun shone again. Tom found himself
saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish there were more fellows in the world like
you, Harry."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry&#39;s eyes opened in momentary astonishment at
the irrelevance, but he was too full of his news and
his request to stay for wonder.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll come, Tom?" he asked. "You won&#39;t refuse
her?" "Could anyone refuse her anything?"
was what his tone said. "We want you, Tom," he went
on. "Hang it, I&#39;ve had no one to speak to lately but
that Cormack woman. I hate that woman. She&#39;s always
hinting something&mdash;some lie or other, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t be too hard on little Mrs. Cormack," said
Tom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span></p>

<p class="indent">He remembered certain words which had shown a
soft spot in Mrs. Cormack&#39;s heart. Harry did not
know that she had grieved to hear him pacing up and
down.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll come, Tom? I know, of course, that
you&#39;ve a right to be angry, and to say you won&#39;t, and
all that. But I know you won&#39;t do it. She&#39;s not
well, Tom; and I&mdash;I can&#39;t always understand her.
You used to understand her, Tom. She used to like
your chaff, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom would not enter on that. He pressed Harry&#39;s
hand, answering,</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course, I&#39;ll come."</p>

<p class="indent">"Bring all this with you," cried Harry. "I shan&#39;t
take up your time. You must stick to your own work
as much as you like. When&#39;ll you come, Tom?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, to-morrow," said Tom Loring.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I might, if you like," smiled Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"That&#39;s right, old chap. You can send round for
your things. Bring a bag, and come to-night. Your
room&#39;s there for you. I told them to keep it ready.
Damn it, Tom, I thought things would come straight
some day, and I kept it ready."</p>

<p class="indent">Had things come straight? Tom did not know.</p>

<p class="indent">"I say," pursued Harry, "I met Ruston to-day.
He was very kind about my cutting the Omofaga. I
wonder if I&#39;ve been unjust to him!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Then Tom smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shouldn&#39;t bother about that, if I were you,"
said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he&#39;s not a thin-skinned chap, is he?" asked
Harry, with relief.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should fancy not," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"You see, he&#39;s off in a fortnight, and I thought
we ought to part friends. So I told him&mdash;well, I said,
you know, that when he came back, we should be glad
to see him."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom began to laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re getting quite a diplomatist, Harry," he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">When Harry bustled away, his high spirits raised
higher still by Tom&#39;s ready assent, Tom put on the
garb of society, and took a cab to Adela Ferrars&#39;.</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;ll be very pleased about this," thought Tom,
as he went along. "It&#39;s good news to take her."</p>

<p class="indent">But whatever else Tom Loring knew, it is certain
that he was not infallible on the subject of women
and their feelings. He recognised the fact (having
indeed suspected it many times before) when Adela,
on the telling of his tidings, flashed out in petulance,</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;s sent for you back?" she asked; and Tom
nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you&#39;re going?" was the next quick question.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I could hardly refuse, could I?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"No; I suppose not&mdash;at least not if you&#39;re Maggie
Dennison&#39;s dog, for her to drive away with a stick
and whistle back at her pleasure."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom had been drinking tea. He set down the
cup, and feebly stroked his thigh with his hand; and
he glanced at Adela (who was rattling the tea things)
with deprecatory surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hadn&#39;t thought of it like that," he ventured to
remark.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, of course, you hadn&#39;t. Maggie sends you
away&mdash;you go. Maggie sends a footman (well, then,
Harry) for you&mdash;and back you go. And I suppose
you&#39;ll say you&#39;re very sorry, won&#39;t you? and you&#39;ll
promise you won&#39;t do it again, won&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t think I shall be asked to do that," said
Tom, speaking seriously, but showing a slight offence
in his manner.</p>

<p class="indent">"But if she tells you to?" asked Adela scornfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d take it like this. Why
shouldn&#39;t I go back?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, go back! Go back and fetch and carry for
Maggie, and write Harry&#39;s speeches till the end of the
chapter. Oh, yes, go back."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom was puzzled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Has anything upset you to-day?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Has anything upset me!" echoed Adela, throwing
her eyes up to the ceiling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Tom finished his tea in a nervous gulp.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t see why I shouldn&#39;t go back," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I&#39;m telling you to go back," said Adela.
"Go back till she&#39;s had enough of you again&mdash;and
then be turned out again."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom&#39;s face grew crimson.</p>

<p class="indent">"At least," he said slowly, "she has never spoken
to me like that."</p>

<p class="indent">Adela had left the table and taken an arm-chair
near the fire. Her back was to the door and her face
towards Tom; she held a fire-screen between her and
him, letting the blaze burn her face. But Tom, being
unobservant, paid no attention to the position of the
fire-screen. With a look of pain on his face, he took
up his hat and rose to his feet. The meeting had
been very different from what he had hoped.</p>

<p class="indent">"When do you go?" she asked brusquely.</p>

<p class="indent">"To-night. I&#39;m just going back to my rooms for
a bag, and then I shall go. I&#39;m sorry you should&mdash;I&#39;m
sorry you don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing right."</p>

<p class="indent">"It doesn&#39;t matter two straws what I think," said
Adela behind the screen.</p>

<p class="indent">"Aye, but it does to me," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">She made no answer, and he stood for a moment,
looking uneasily at the intruding fire-screen.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, good-bye," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall see you soon, I hope."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"If Maggie will let you come."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know," said Tom, "what pleasure you
find in that. It seems to me that as a gentleman&mdash;to
say nothing of my being their friend&mdash;I must go back."</p>

<p class="indent">She made no retort to this, and he moved a step
towards the door. Then he turned and glanced at
her. She had dropped the screen and her eyes were
fixed on the fire. He sighed, frowned, shrugged his
shoulders, turned, and made for the door again. In
another second he would have been gone, but Adela
cried softly,</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Loring."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he answered, coming to a halt.</p>

<p class="indent">"Stay where you are a minute. Will you stay
there a minute?"</p>

<p class="indent">"An hour if you like," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"I just want to say that&mdash;that&mdash;You&#39;re coming
nearer!&mdash;I want you to stay just where you are."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom halted. He had, in fact, been coming slowly
towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose," said Adela, in quite an indifferent
tone, "that you&#39;ll settle down with the Dennisons
again?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t know. Yes; I suppose so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you," said Adela, sinking far into the recesses
of the arm-chair, and holding up the screen
again, "like being there better than anywhere else?
I suppose Maggie is very charming?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"You know just what she is."</p>

<p class="indent">"I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t. I&#39;m a woman."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long pause. Tom felt absurd, standing
there in the middle of the room. Suddenly Adela
leapt to her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, go away! Yes, you&#39;re right to go back. Oh,
yes, you&#39;re quite right. Good-bye, Mr. Loring."</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment longer Tom stood still; then he
moved, not towards the door, but towards Adela.
When he spoke to her it was in a husky voice. There
were no sweet seducing tones in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"There&#39;s only one place in the world I really care
to be," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not speak.</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry and Mrs. Dennison are my friends," he
said, "and as long as my time&#39;s my own, I&#39;ll give it
to them. But you don&#39;t suppose I go there for happiness?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t suppose you ever did anything for happiness,"
said Adela, as though she were advancing a
heinous charge. "Really, nothing makes me so impatient
as an unselfish man."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom smiled, but his smile was still a nervous one.
Nevertheless he felt less absurd. A distant presage of
triumph stole into his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t you want me to go?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"You may go wherever you like," said she.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom came still nearer. Adela held out her hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
and said "good-bye." Tom took the hand and
held it.</p>

<p class="indent">"You see," he said, "I didn&#39;t think I had anywhere
else to go. I did know a charming lady who
was very witty and&mdash;very rich&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I&#39;ll put some more in Omofaga and lose it.
Oh, you are stupid, Tom! I really thought I should
have to ask you myself, Tom. I&#39;d have done it sooner
than let you go."</p>

<p class="indent">It was not, happily, in the end necessary, and Adela
said with a sigh,</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe that I&#39;ve something to thank Mr. Ruston
for, after all."</p>

<p class="indent">"What&#39;s that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, he made me resolved to marry the man who
of all the world was most unlike him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I&#39;ve something to thank him for too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tom," she said, "I don&#39;t know what I said to you.
I&mdash;I was jealous of Maggie Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">It was later by an hour when Tom Loring took his
way, not to his rooms for a bag, but straight to Curzon
Street. Adela had consented not to wait ("In
one&#39;s eleventh season one does not want to wait," she
said), and Tom considered that it was now hardly
worth while to move. So he broke into Harry Dennison&#39;s
study with a radiant face, crying,</p>

<p class="indent">"Harry, I&#39;m not coming to you after all, old fellow."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Harry started up in dismay, but a short explanation
turned his sorrow into rejoicing. Again and
again he shook Tom&#39;s hand, telling him that the man
who won a good wife won the greatest treasure earth
could offer&mdash;and (he added) "by Jove, Tom, I believe
the best chance of heaven too," and Tom gripped
Harry&#39;s hand and cleared his own throat. Then
they both felt very much ashamed, and, by way of forgetting
this deplorable outburst of emotion (which
Tom felt was quite un-English, and smacked indeed
of Mrs. Cormack), agreed to go upstairs and announce
the news to Maggie.</p>

<p class="indent">"She&#39;ll be delighted," said Harry.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom followed him upstairs to the drawing-room.
Mrs. Dennison was sitting by the fire, doing nothing.
But she sprang up when they came in, and advanced
to meet Tom. He also felt like an ill-used subject as
she gave him her hand and said,</p>

<p class="indent">"How forgiving you are, Tom!"</p>

<p class="indent">He looked in her face, and found her smiling under
sad eyes. And he muttered some confused words
about "all that" not mattering "tuppence." And indeed
Mrs. Dennison seemed content to take the same
view, for she smiled again and said,</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, well, there&#39;s an end of it, anyhow."</p>

<p class="indent">Then Harry, who had been wondering why Tom
delayed his tidings, burst out with them, and Tom
added lamely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, it&#39;s true, Mrs. Dennison. So you see I can&#39;t
come."</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must accept your excuse," she said, and added
a few kind words. "As for Adela," she went on,
"she&#39;s never been to see me lately, but for your sake
I&#39;ll be humble and go and see her to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry, as though suddenly remembering, exclaimed
that he must tell the children; in fact, he
had an idea that a man liked to talk about his engagement
to a woman alone, and plumed himself on
getting out of the room with some dexterity. So
Tom and Maggie Dennison were left for a little while
together.</p>

<p class="indent">At first they talked of Adela, but it was on Tom&#39;s
mind to say something else, and at last he contrived to
give it utterance.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can&#39;t tell you," he said, looking away from her,
"how glad I was to get your message. This&mdash;this
trouble&mdash;has been horrible. I know I behaved like a
sulky fool. I was quite wrong. It&#39;s awfully good of
you to forget it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don&#39;t talk like that," she said in a low, slow
voice. "How do you think Harry&#39;s looking?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, better than I have seen him for a long
time. But you&#39;re not looking very blooming, Mrs.
Dennison."</p>

<p class="indent">She leant forward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think he&#39;s happy, or is he worrying? He
talks to you, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"I think he&#39;s happier than he&#39;s been for months."</p>

<p class="indent">She lay back with a sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope so," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you?" he asked, timidly yet urgently.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed useless to pretend complete ignorance,
yet impossible to assert any knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, why talk about me? Talk about Adela."</p>

<p class="indent">"I love Adela," he said gravely, "as I&#39;ve never
loved any other woman. But when I was a young
man and came here, you were very kind to me. And
I&mdash;no, I&#39;ll go on now&mdash;I looked up to you, and
thought you the&mdash;the grandest woman I knew; and
to us young men you were a sort of queen. Well, I
haven&#39;t changed, Mrs. Dennison. I still think all
that, and, if you ever want a friend to help you,
or&mdash;or a servant to serve you, why, you can call
on me."</p>

<p class="indent">She sat silent while he spoke, gazing at the ground
in front of her. Tom grew bolder.</p>

<p class="indent">"There was one thing I came to Dieppe to do, but
I hadn&#39;t the courage there. I wanted to tell you that
Harry&mdash;that Harry was worthy of your love. I
thought&mdash;well, I&#39;ve gone further than I thought I
could. You know; you must forgive me. If there&#39;s
one thing in all the world that makes me feel all I
ever felt for you, and more, it&#39;s to see him happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
again, and you here trying to make him. Because I
know that, in a way, it&#39;s difficult."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I know. And, because I know, I tell you
that you&#39;re a wife any man might thank God for."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison laughed; and Tom started at the
jarring sound. Yet it was not a sound of mirth.</p>

<p class="indent">"You had temptations most of us haven&#39;t&mdash;yes,
and a nature most of us haven&#39;t. And here you are.
So,"&mdash;he rose from his chair and took her hand that
drooped beside her, and bent his head and kissed it&mdash;"though
I love Adela with all my heart, still I kiss
your hand as your true and grateful servant, as I used
to be in old days."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom stopped; he had said his say, and his voice
had grown tremulous in the saying. Yet he had done
it; he had told her what he felt; and he prayed that
it might comfort her in the trouble that had lined her
forehead and made her eyes sad.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dennison did not glance at him. For a moment
she sat quite silent. Then she said,</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks, Tom," and pressed his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she suddenly sat up in her chair and held
her hand out before her, and whispered to him words
that he hardly heard.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you knew," she said, "you wouldn&#39;t kiss it;
you&#39;d spit on it."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom stood, silently, suddenly, wretchedly conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
that he did not know what he ought to do. Then he
blurted out,</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;ll stay with him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I shall stay with him," she said, glancing
up; and Tom seemed to see in her eyes the picture of
the long future that her words meant. And he went
away with his joy eclipsed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>THE MOVING CAR.</h3>

<p class="indent">In the month of June two years later, Lord Semingham
sat on the terrace outside the drawing-room
windows of his country house. By him sat Adela
Loring, and Tom was to be seen a hundred yards
away, smoking a pipe, and talking to Harry Dennison.
Suddenly Semingham, who had been reading the
newspaper, broke into a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Listen to this," said he. "It is true that the vote
for the Omofaga railway was carried, but a majority of
ten is not a glorious victory, and there can be little
doubt that the prestige of the Government will suffer
considerably by such a narrow escape from defeat, and
by Lord Detchmore&#39;s ill-advised championship of Mr.
Ruston&#39;s speculative schemes. Why is the British
Government to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for
Mr. Ruston? That is what we ask."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Semingham paused and added,</p>

<p class="indent">"They may well ask. I don&#39;t know. Do you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yesterday," observed Adela, "I received a communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
from you in your official capacity. It was
not a pleasant letter, Lord Semingham."</p>

<p class="indent">"I daresay not, madam," said Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"You told me that the Board regretted to say
that, owing to unforeseen hindrances, the work in
Omofaga had not advanced as rapidly as had been
hoped, and that for the present it was considered
advisable to devote all profits to the development of the
Company&#39;s territory. You added however, that you
had the utmost confidence in Mr. Ruston&#39;s zeal and
ability, and in the ultimate success of the Company."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; that was the circular," said Semingham.
"That is, in fact, for some time likely to be the circular."</p>

<p class="indent">They both laughed; then both grew grave, and sat
silent side by side.</p>

<p class="indent">The drawing-room window was thrown open, and
Lady Semingham looked out. She held a letter in
her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, fancy, Adela!" she cried. "Such a terrible
thing has happened. I&#39;ve had a letter from Marjory
Valentine&mdash;she&#39;s in awful grief, poor child."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, what about?" cried Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor young Walter Valentine has died of fever
in Omofaga. He caught it at Fort Imperial, and he
was dead in a week. Poor Lady Valentine! Isn&#39;t it
sad?"</p>

<p class="indent">Adela and Semingham looked at one another. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
moment ago they had jested on the sacrifices demanded
by Omofaga; Semingham had seen in the division on
the vote for the railway a delightful extravagant burlesque
on a larger stage of the fatefulness which he
had whimsically read into Willie Ruston&#39;s darling
scheme. Adela had fallen into his mood, adducing
the circular as her evidence. They were taken at
their word in grim earnest. Omofaga claimed real
tears, as though in conscious malice it had set itself to
outplay them at their sport.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don&#39;t say anything, Alfred," complained
little Lady Semingham from the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is there to say?" asked he, spreading out
his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">"The only son of his mother, and she is a widow,"
whispered Adela, gazing away over the sunny meadows.</p>

<p class="indent">Bessie Semingham looked at the pair for an
instant, vaguely dissatisfied with their want of demonstrativeness.
There seemed, as Alfred said, very
little to say; it was so sad that there ought to have
been more to say. But she could think of nothing
herself, so, in her pretty little lisp, she repeated,</p>

<p class="indent">"How sad for poor Lady Valentine!" and slowly
shut the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"He was a bright boy, with the makings of a man
in him," said Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">Adela nodded, and for a long while neither spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
again. Then Semingham, with the air of a man who
seeks relief from sad thoughts which cannot alter
sadder facts, asked,</p>

<p class="indent">"Where are the Dennisons?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She went for a walk by herself, but I think she&#39;s
come back and gone a stroll with Tom and Harry."
As she spoke, she looked up and caught a puzzled
look in Semingham&#39;s eye. "Yes," she went on in
quick understanding. "I don&#39;t quite understand her
either."</p>

<p class="indent">"But what do you think?" he asked, in his insatiable
curiosity that no other feeling could altogether
master.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don&#39;t want to think about it," said Adela.
"But, yes, I&#39;ll tell you, if you like. She isn&#39;t
happy."</p>

<p class="indent">"No. I could tell you that," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"But Harry is happy. Lord Semingham, when I
see her with him&mdash;her sweetness and kindness to him&mdash;I
wonder."</p>

<p class="indent">This time it was Semingham who nodded silent
assent.</p>

<p class="indent">"And," said Adela, with a glance of what seemed
like defiance, "I pray."</p>

<p class="indent">"You&#39;re a good woman, Adela," said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"He sees no change in her, or he sees a change
that makes him love her more. Surely, surely, some
day, Lord Semingham&mdash;&mdash;?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span></p>

<p class="indent">She broke off, leaving her hope unexpressed, but
a faint smile on her face told of it.</p>

<p class="indent">"It may be&mdash;some day," he said, as though he
hardly hoped. Then, with one of his quick retreats,
he took refuge in asking, "Are you happy with your
husband, Adela? I hope to goodness you are."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perfectly," she answered, with a bright passing
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"But you get no dividends," he suggested, raising
his brows.</p>

<p class="indent">"No; no dividends," said she. "No more do you."</p>

<p class="indent">"No; but we shall."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose we shall."</p>

<p class="indent">"He&#39;ll pull us through."</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish he&#39;d never been born," cried Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps. Since he has, I shall keep my eye on
him."</p>

<p class="indent">From the shrubbery at the side of the lawn,
Maggie Dennison came out. She was leaning on her
husband&#39;s arm, and Tom Loring walked with them.
A minute later they had heard from Adela the news
of the ending of young Sir Walter&#39;s life and hopes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good God!" cried Harry Dennison in grief.</p>

<p class="indent">They sat down and began to talk sadly of the lost
boy. Only Maggie Dennison said nothing. Her eyes
were fixed on the sky, and she seemed hardly to hear.
Yet Adela, stealing a glance at her, saw her clenched
hand quiver.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span></p>

<p class="indent">"Do you remember," asked Semingham, "how at
Dieppe Bessie would have it that the little red crosses
were tombstones? She was quite pleased with the
idea."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; and how horrified the old Baron was,"
said Adela.</p>

<p class="indent">"Both he and Walter gone!" mused Harry Dennison.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, the omen is fulfilled now," said Tom Loring.
"Ruston need not fear for himself."</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Dennison turned a sudden uneasy glance
upon his wife. She looked up and met it with a calm
sad smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"He was a brave boy," she said. "Mr. Ruston
will be very sorry." She rose and laid her hand on
her husband&#39;s arm. "Come, Harry," she said, "we&#39;ll
walk again."</p>

<p class="indent">He rose and gave her his arm. She paused, glancing
from one to the other of the group.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mustn&#39;t think he won&#39;t be sorry," she said
pleadingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she pressed her husband&#39;s arm and walked
away with him. They passed again into the fringing
shrubbery and were lost to view. Tom Loring did
not go with them this time, but sat down by his wife&#39;s
side. For a while no one spoke. Then Adela said
softly,</p>

<p class="indent">"She knows him better than we do. I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span>
he will be sorry. Will he be sorry for Marjory
too?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If he thinks of her," said Semingham.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;if he thinks of her."</p>

<p class="indent">Semingham lit a cigarette and watched the smoke
curl skywards.</p>

<p class="indent">"Some of us are bruised," said he, "and some of
us are broken."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not beyond cure?" Adela beseeched, touching
his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"God knows," said he with a shrug.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not beyond cure?" she said again, insisting.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope not, my dear," said Tom Loring gently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bruised or broken&mdash;bruised or broken!" mused
Semingham, watching his smoke-rings. "But the
car moves on, eh, Adela?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, the car moves on," said she.</p>

<p class="indent">"And I don&#39;t know," said Tom Loring, "that I&#39;d
care to be the god who sits in it."</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">While Maggie Dennison walked with Harry in the
shrubbery, and the group on the terrace talked of the
god in the car, on the other side of the world a man
sat looking out of a window under a new-risen sun.
Presently his eyes dropped, and they fell on a wooden
cross that stood below the window. A cheap wreath
of artificial flowers decked it&mdash;a wreath one of Ruston&#39;s
company had carried over seas from the grave of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg&nbsp;339]</span>
his dead wife, and had brought out of his treasures to
honour young Sir Walter&#39;s grave; because he and
they all had loved the boy. And, as Maggie Dennison
had said, Ruston also was sorry. His eyes dwelt on
the cross, while he seemed to hear again Walter&#39;s
merry laugh and confident ringing tones, and to see
his brave, lithe figure as he sprang on his horse and
cantered ahead of the party, eager for the road, or the
sport, aye, or the fight. For a moment Willie Ruston&#39;s
head fell, then he got up&mdash;the cross had sent his
thoughts back to the far-off land he had left. He
walked across the little square room to an iron-bound
box; unlocking it, he searched amid a pile of papers
and found a woman&#39;s letter. He began to read it, but,
when he had read but half, he laid it gently down
again among the papers and closed and locked the
box. His face was white and set, his eyes gleamed as
if in anger. Suddenly he muttered to himself,</p>

<p class="indent">"I loved that boy. I never thought of it killing
him."</p>

<p class="indent">And on thought of the boy came another, and
for an instant the stern mouth quivered, and he half-turned
towards the box again. Then he jerked his
head, muttering again; yet his face was softer, till a
heavy frown grew upon it, and he pressed his hand
for the shortest moment to his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">It was over&mdash;over, though it was to come again.
Treading heavily on the floor&mdash;there was no lightness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
left in his step&mdash;he reached the door, and found a
dozen mounted men waiting for him, and a horse held
for him. He looked round on the men; they were
fine fellows, tall and stalwart, ready for anything.
Slowly a smile broke on his face, an unmirthful smile,
that lasted but till he had said,</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, boys, we must teach these fellows a little
lesson to-day."</p>

<p class="indent">His followers laughed and joked, but none joined
him where he rode at their head. The chief was a
man to follow, not to ride with, they said, half in
liking, half in dislike, wholly in trust and deference.
Yet in old days he had been good to ride with too.</p>

<p class="indent">The car was moving on. Maybe Tom Loring was
not very wrong, when he said that he would not care
to be the man who sat in it.</p>
